<h2>TRIFLES</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <em>The kitchen in the now abandoned farmhouse
of <span class="smcap">John Wright</span>, a gloomy kitchen, and left
without having been put in order&mdash;unwashed pans
under the sink, a loaf of bread outside the bread-box,
a dish-towel on the table&mdash;other signs of incompleted
work. At the rear the outer door opens and the
<span class="smcap">Sheriff</span> comes in followed by the <span class="smcap">County Attorney</span>
and <span class="smcap">Hale</span>. The <span class="smcap">Sheriff</span> and <span class="smcap">Hale</span> are men in middle
life, the <span class="smcap">County Attorney</span> is a young man; all are
much bundled up and go at once to the stove. They
are followed by the two women&mdash;the <span class="smcap">Sheriff’s</span> wife
first; she is a slight wiry woman, a thin nervous face.
<span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale</span> is larger and would ordinarily be called
more comfortable looking, but she is disturbed now
and looks fearfully about as she enters. The women
have come in slowly, and stand close together near the
door.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span></p>

<p>[<em>Rubbing his hands.</em>] This feels good. Come up
to the fire, ladies.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters</span></p>

<p>[<em>After taking a step forward.</em>] I’m not&mdash;cold.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Sheriff</span></p>

<p>[<em>Unbuttoning his overcoat and stepping away from
the stove as if to mark the beginning of official business.</em>]
Now, Mr. Hale, before we move things about,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
you explain to Mr. Henderson just what you saw
when you came here yesterday morning.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span></p>

<p>By the way, has anything been moved? Are things
just as you left them yesterday?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Sheriff</span></p>

<p>[<em>Looking about.</em>] It’s just the same. When it
dropped below zero last night I thought I’d better
send Frank out this morning to make a fire for us&mdash;no
use getting pneumonia with a big case on, but I
told him not to touch anything except the stove&mdash;and
you know Frank.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span></p>

<p>Somebody should have been left here yesterday.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Sheriff</span></p>

<p>Oh&mdash;yesterday. When I had to send Frank to
Morris Center for that man who went crazy&mdash;I want
you to know I had my hands full yesterday. I knew
you could get back from Omaha by today and as
long as I went over everything here myself&mdash;</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span></p>

<p>Well, Mr. Hale, tell just what happened when you
came here yesterday morning.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Hale</span></p>

<p>Harry and I had started to town with a load of
potatoes. We came along the road from my place
and as I got here I said, “I’m going to see if I can’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
get John Wright to go in with me on a party telephone.”
I spoke to Wright about it once before and he put
me off, saying folks talked too much anyway, and all
he asked was peace and quiet&mdash;I guess you know
about how much he talked himself; but I thought
maybe if I went to the house and talked about it before
his wife, though I said to Harry that I didn’t know
as what his wife wanted made much difference to
John&mdash;</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span></p>

<p>Let’s talk about that later, Mr. Hale. I do want
to talk about that, but tell now just what happened
when you got to the house.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Hale</span></p>

<p>I didn’t hear or see anything; I knocked at the
door, and still it was all quiet inside. I knew they
must be up, it was past eight o’clock. So I knocked
again, and I thought I heard somebody say, “Come in.”
I wasn’t sure, I’m not sure yet, but I opened the door&mdash;this
door [<em>indicating the door by which the two
women are still standing</em>] and there in that rocker&mdash;[<em>pointing
to it</em>] sat Mrs. Wright.</p>

<p class="sd">[<em>They all look at the rocker.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span></p>

<p>What&mdash;was she doing?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Hale</span></p>

<p>She was rockin’ back and forth. She had her apron
in her hand and was kind of&mdash;pleating it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span></p>

<p>And how did she&mdash;look?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Hale</span></p>

<p>Well, she looked queer.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span></p>

<p>How do you mean&mdash;queer?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Hale</span></p>

<p>Well, as if she didn’t know what she was going
to do next. And kind of done up.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span></p>

<p>How did she seem to feel about your coming?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Hale</span></p>

<p>Why, I don’t think she minded&mdash;one way or other.
She didn’t pay much attention. I said, “How do,
Mrs. Wright, it’s cold, ain’t it?” And she said, “Is
it?”&mdash;and went on kind of pleating at her apron.
Well, I was surprised; she didn’t ask me to come up
to the stove, or to set down, but just sat there, not even
looking at me, so I said, “I want to see John.” And
then she&mdash;laughed. I guess you would call it a laugh.
I thought of Harry and the team outside, so I said
a little sharp: “Can’t I see John?” “No,” she
says, kind o’ dull like. “Ain’t he home?” says I.
“Yes,” says she, “he’s home.” “Then why can’t I
see him?” I asked her, out of patience. “’Cause
he’s dead,” says she. “<em>Dead?</em>” says I. She just
nodded her head, not getting a bit excited, but rockin’
back and forth. “Why&mdash;where is he?” says I, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
knowing what to say. She just pointed upstairs&mdash;like
that [<em>himself pointing to the room above</em>]. I
got up, with the idea of going up there. I walked
from there to here&mdash;then I says, “Why, what did
he die of?” “He died of a rope round his neck,”
says she, and just went on pleatin’ at her apron. Well,
I went out and called Harry. I thought I might&mdash;need
help. We went upstairs and there he was lyin’&mdash;</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span></p>

<p>I think I’d rather have you go into that upstairs,
where you can point it all out. Just go on now with
the rest of the story.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Hale</span></p>

<p>Well, my first thought was to get that rope off. It
looked ... [<em>Stops, his face twitches</em>] ... but Harry,
he went up to him, and he said, “No, he’s dead all
right, and we’d better not touch anything.” So we
went back down stairs. She was still sitting that same
way. “Has anybody been notified?” I asked. “No,”
says she, unconcerned. “Who did this, Mrs.
Wright?” said Harry. He said it business-like&mdash;and
she stopped pleatin’ of her apron. “I don’t
know,” she says. “You don’t <em>know</em>?” says Harry.
“No,” says she. “Weren’t you sleepin’ in the bed
with him?” says Harry. “Yes,” says she, “but I
was on the inside.” “Somebody slipped a rope round
his neck and strangled him and you didn’t wake up?”
says Harry. “I didn’t wake up,” she said after him.
We must ’a looked as if we didn’t see how that could
be, for after a minute she said, “I sleep sound.”
Harry was going to ask her more questions but I said
maybe we ought to let her tell her story first to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
coroner, or the sheriff, so Harry went fast as he could
to Rivers’ place, where there’s a telephone.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span></p>

<p>And what did Mrs. Wright do when she knew that
you had gone for the coroner?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Hale</span></p>

<p>She moved from that chair to this one over here
[<em>Pointing to a small chair in the corner</em>] and just sat
there with her hands held together and looking down.
I got a feeling that I ought to make some conversation,
so I said I had come in to see if John wanted to put
in a telephone, and at that she started to laugh, and
then she stopped and looked at me&mdash;scared. [<em>The
<span class="smcap">County Attorney</span>, who has had his notebook out,
makes a note.</em>] I dunno, maybe it wasn’t scared. I
wouldn’t like to say it was. Soon Harry got back, and
then Dr. Lloyd came, and you, Mr. Peters, and so I
guess that’s all I know that you don’t.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span></p>

<p>[<em>Looking around.</em>] I guess we’ll go upstairs first&mdash;and
then out to the barn and around there. [<em>To
the <span class="smcap">Sheriff</span>.</em>] You’re convinced that there was nothing
important here&mdash;nothing that would point to any
motive.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Sheriff</span></p>

<p>Nothing here but kitchen things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p class="sd">[<em>The <span class="smcap">County Attorney</span>, after again
looking around the kitchen, opens
the door of a cupboard closet. He
gets up on a chair and looks on a
shelf. Pulls his hand away, sticky.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span></p>

<p>Here’s a nice mess.</p>

<p class="sd">[<em>The women draw nearer.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters</span></p>

<p>[<em>To the other woman.</em>] Oh, her fruit; it did freeze.
[<em>To the <span class="smcap">Lawyer</span>.</em>] She worried about that when it
turned so cold. She said the fire’d go out and her
jars would break.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Sheriff</span></p>

<p>Well, can you beat the women! Held for murder
and worryin’ about her preserves.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span></p>

<p>I guess before we’re through she may have something
more serious than preserves to worry about.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Hale</span></p>

<p>Well, women are used to worrying over trifles.</p>

<p class="sd">[<em>The two women move a little closer
together.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span></p>

<p>[<em>With the gallantry of a young politician.</em>] And
yet, for all their worries, what would we do without
the ladies? [<em>The women do not unbend. He goes
to the sink, takes a dipperful of water from the pail
and pouring it into a basin, washes his hands. Starts
to wipe them on the roller-towel, turns it for a cleaner
place.</em>] Dirty towels! [<em>Kicks his foot against the
pans under the sink.</em>] Not much of a housekeeper,
would you say, ladies?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale</span></p>

<p>[<em>Stiffly.</em>] There’s a great deal of work to be done
on a farm.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span></p>

<p>To be sure. And yet [<em>With a little bow to her</em>] I
know there are some Dickson county farmhouses which
do not have such roller towels.</p>

<p class="sd">[<em>He gives it a pull to expose its full
length again.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale</span></p>

<p>Those towels get dirty awful quick. Men’s hands
aren’t always as clean as they might be.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span></p>

<p>Ah, loyal to your sex, I see. But you and Mrs.
Wright were neighbors. I suppose you were friends,
too.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale</span></p>

<p>[<em>Shaking her head.</em>] I’ve not seen much of her of
late years. I’ve not been in this house&mdash;it’s more
than a year.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span></p>

<p>And why was that? You didn’t like her?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale</span></p>

<p>I liked her all well enough. Farmers’ wives have
their hands full, Mr. Henderson. And then&mdash;</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span></p>

<p>Yes&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale</span></p>

<p>[<em>Looking about.</em>] It never seemed a very cheerful
place.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span></p>

<p>No&mdash;it’s not cheerful. I shouldn’t say she had the
homemaking instinct.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale</span></p>

<p>Well, I don’t know as Wright had, either.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span></p>

<p>You mean that they didn’t get on very well?</p>

<h2>THE PEOPLE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <em>The office of “The People,” a morning in
March, 1917. There is little furniture&mdash;a long table
strewn with manuscripts and papers, a desk. On the
walls are revolutionary posters; wads of paper are
thrown about on the floor&mdash;the office of a publication
which is radical and poor. This is an inner office;
at the rear is the door into the outer one. <span class="smcap">Oscar</span> is
seated at the table writing. <span class="smcap">Tom</span>, a printer who loves
the cause&mdash;or the crowd&mdash;almost enough to print
for it, comes from the other room, a galley-proof in
his hand.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Tom</span></p>

<p>Why are you writing?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Oscar</span></p>

<p>[<em>Jauntily.</em>] Because I am a writer.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Tom</span></p>

<p>But I thought you said there wasn’t going to be
another issue of <cite>The People</cite>.</p>

<p>[<em>With dignity.</em>] I am writing.</p>

<p>[<em>After writing.</em>] All right.</p>

<p class="sd">[<em><span class="smcap">Tom</span> goes out and a moment later the
woman appears. She is middle
aged, wears plain clothes not in fashion.

room, her face is the face of one who
has come a long way and reached a
wonderful place.</em></p>

<p>The people. It’s so wonderful to see them&mdash;so
many of them. Don’t you often just stand and watch
them?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Oscar</span></p>

<p>No, madam, not often. I am too busy editing a
magazine about them.</p>

for one sunny afternoon to a lovely hillside, and finding
a hole, crawls in there till after the sun is set. I
want that child to know the sun is shining upon flowers
in the grass. I want him to know it before he has
to go back to the room that is dark. I wish I had
pipes to call him to the hilltop of beautiful distances.
I myself could see farther if he were seeing at all.
Perhaps I can tell <em>you</em>: you who have dreamed and
dreaming know, and knowing care. Move! Move
from the things that hold you. If you move, others
will move. Come! Now. Before the sun goes

cows standing around a pump. A tile yard, a water
tank, one straight street of a little town. The country
so still it seems dead. The trees like&mdash;hopes that
have been given up. The grave yards&mdash;on hills&mdash;they
come so fast. I noticed them first because of
my tombstone, but I got to thinking about the people&mdash;the
people who spent their whole lives right near
the places where they are now. There’s something
in the thought of them&mdash;like the cows standing around
the pump. So still, so patient, it&mdash;kind of hurts.
And their pleasures:&mdash;a flat field fenced in. Your
great words carried me to other great words. I
thought of Lincoln, and what he said of a few of the
dead. I said it over and over. I said things and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
didn’t know the meaning of them ’till after I had said
them. I said&mdash;“The truth&mdash;the truth&mdash;the truth
that opens from our lives as water opens from the
rocks.” Then I knew what that truth was. [<em>Pause,
with an intensity peculiarly simple.</em>] “Let us here
highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in
vain.” I mean&mdash;all of them. [<em>A gesture, wide, loving.</em>]
Let life become what it may become!&mdash;so beautiful
that everything that is back of us is worth everything
it cost.</p>

<h2>CLOSE THE BOOK</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <em>The library in the <span class="smcap">Root</span> home, the library
of middle-western people who are an important family
in their community, a university town, and who think
of themselves as people of culture. It is a room which
shows pride of family: on the rear wall are two large
family portraits&mdash;one a Revolutionary soldier, the
other a man of a later period. On the low book-cases,
to both sides of door rear, and on the mantel, right,
are miniatures and other old pictures. There is old
furniture&mdash;mahogany recently done over: an easy
chair near the fireplace, a divan left. A Winged Victory
presides over one of the book-cases, a Burne
Jones is hung. It is a warmly lighted, cheerful room&mdash;books
and flowers about. At the rear is a door
opening on the hall, at the left a door into another
room. There is a corner window at the right.
<span class="smcap">Jhansi</span> and <span class="smcap">Peyton</span> are seated on the divan. <span class="smcap">Mrs.
Root</span> is just going into the hall. She seems perturbed.
<span class="smcap">Jhansi</span> is dressed as a non-conformist, but attractively.
<span class="smcap">Peyton</span> is a rather helpless young man, with a sense
of humor that is itself rather helpless.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Root</span></p>

<p>I’ll see, Peyton, if your grandmother isn’t ready
to come down.</p>

<p class="sd">[<em>She leaves them.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Jhansi</span></p>

<p>[<em>Springing up.</em>] It’s absurd that I should be here!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Peyton</span></p>

<p>I know, Jhansi, but just this once&mdash;as long as it
means so much to mother, and doesn’t really hurt us.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Jhansi</span></p>

<p>But it does hurt me, Peyton. These walls stifle
me. You come of people who have been walled in all
their lives. It doesn’t cage you. But me&mdash;I am a
gypsy! Sometimes I feel them right behind me&mdash;all
those wanderers, people who were never caught; feel
them behind me pushing me away from all this!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Peyton</span></p>

<p>But not pushing you away from me, dear. You
love me, Jhansi, in spite of my family?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Jhansi</span></p>

<p>If I didn’t love you do you think I could endure
to come to this dreadful place? [<em>A look about the
comfortable room</em>]&mdash;and meet these dreadful people?
Forgive me for alluding to your home and family,
Peyton, but I must not lose my honesty, you know.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Peyton</span></p>

<p>No, dear; I don’t think you are losing it. And
perhaps I’d better not lose mine either. There’s one
thing I haven’t mentioned yet. [<em>Hesitates.</em>] Mr.
Peyton is coming to dinner tonight.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Jhansi</span></p>

<p>Mr. Peyton. <em>What</em> Peyton?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Peyton</span></p>

<p>Yes&mdash;that one.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Jhansi</span></p>

<p>And you ask me&mdash;standing for the things I do
in this university&mdash;to sit down to dinner with the
president of the board of regents!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Peyton</span></p>

<p>Mother’d asked him before I knew it.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Jhansi</span></p>

<p>[<em>With scorn.</em>] Your uncle!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Peyton</span></p>

<p>He’s not my uncle&mdash;he’s mother’s. And you see
it’s partly on account of grandmother just getting
back from California. He’s grandmother’s brother-in-law,
you know. I suppose she doesn’t realize what
it means to have to sit down to dinner with him&mdash;she’s
done it so much. And then mother thought
it would be nice for you to meet him.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Jhansi</span></p>

<p>Nice!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Peyton</span></p>

<p>He’s pleasant at dinner.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Jhansi</span></p>

<p>Pleasant!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Peyton</span></p>

<p>Mother’s a little worried about my position in the
university.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Jhansi</span></p>

<p>It would be wonderful for you to lose your position
in the university.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Peyton</span></p>

<p>Yes&mdash;wonderful.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Jhansi</span></p>

<p>And then you and I could walk forth free!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Peyton</span></p>

<p>Free&mdash;but broke.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Jhansi</span></p>

<p>Peyton, you disappoint me. Just the fact that that
man is coming to dinner changes you.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Peyton</span></p>

<p>Oh, no. But you are fortunately situated, Jhansi,
having no people. It’s easier to be free when there’s
nobody who minds.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Jhansi</span></p>

<p>I am going!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Peyton</span></p>

<p>Oh come now, dearest, you can’t go when you’re
expected for dinner. Nobody’s that free.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Jhansi</span></p>

<p>Dinner! A dinner to celebrate our engagement!
It’s humiliating, Peyton. I should take you by the
hand and you and I should walk together down the
open road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Peyton</span></p>

<p>We will, Jhansi; we will&mdash;in time.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Jhansi</span></p>

<p>We should go now.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Peyton</span></p>

<p>Think so? Mother’s going to have turkey.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Jhansi</span></p>

<p>Better a dinner of berries and nuts&mdash;!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Peyton</span></p>

<p>We’ll have berries&mdash;cranberries, and nuts, too.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Jhansi</span></p>

<p>Where is my coat?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Peyton</span></p>

<p>[<em>Seizing her and kissing her.</em>] Some day, serene
and unhampered, we’ll take to the open road&mdash;a road
with berries and nuts.</p>

<p class="sd">[<em><span class="smcap">Grandmother Peyton</span> and <span class="smcap">Mrs. Root</span>
are at the door.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Root</span></p>

<p>Mother, this is Peyton’s friend Miss Mason. One
of our important students.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span></p>

<p>[<em>In her brittle way.</em>] Yes? I never was a very
important student myself. I didn’t like to study. Because
my family were professors, I suppose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Root</span></p>

<p>Peyton’s grandmother is a descendant of Gustave
Phelps&mdash;one of the famous teachers of pioneer days.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Jhansi</span></p>

<p>[<em>Her head going up.</em>] I am a descendant of people
who never taught anybody anything!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Peyton</span></p>

<p>Jhansi and I were just going to finish an article
on Free Speech which must get to the Torch this
evening.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span></p>

<p>[<em>Moving toward the big chair near the fire.</em>] Free
Speech? How amusing.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Peyton</span></p>

<p>You may be less amused some day, grandmother.</p>

<p class="sd">[<em><span class="smcap">Jhansi</span> and <span class="smcap">Peyton</span> go into the other
room.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span></p>

<p>That may be a free speech. I wouldn’t call it a
pleasant one.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Root</span></p>

<p>[<em>Sinking to the divan.</em>] Oh, he was speaking of
the open road again&mdash;berries and nuts&mdash;!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span></p>

<p>[<em>Beginning to knit.</em>] Berries and nuts? Well, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
sounds quite innocuous to me. Some of our young
people are less simple in their tastes.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Root</span></p>

<p>[<em>In great distress.</em>] Mother, how would you like
to see your grandson become a gypsy?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span></p>

<p>Peyton a gypsy? You mean in a carnival?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Root</span></p>

<p>No, not in a carnival! In <em>life</em>.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span></p>

<p>But he isn’t dark enough.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Root</span></p>

<p>And is <em>that</em> the only thing against it! I had thought
you would be a help to me, mother.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span></p>

<p>Well, my dear Clara, I have no doubt I will be a
help to you&mdash;in time. This idea of Peyton becoming
a gypsy is too startling for me to be a help instantly.
In the first place, could he be? You can’t be anything
you take it into your head to be&mdash;even if it is undesirable.
And then, why should he be? Doesn’t he
still teach English right here in the university?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Root</span></p>

<p>I don’t know how much longer he’ll teach it. He
said the other day that American literature was a
toddy with the <em>stick</em> left out. Saying that of the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
thing he’s paid to teach! It got in the papers and
was denounced in an editorial on “Untrue Americans.”
Peyton&mdash;a descendant of John Peyton of Valley
Forge! [<em>Indicates the Revolutionary portrait</em>]&mdash;denounced
in an article on Untrue Americans! And in
one of those awful columns&mdash;those silly columns&mdash;they
said maybe the stick hadn’t been left out of his
toddy. But it isn’t that. Peyton doesn’t drink&mdash;to
speak of. It’s this girl. <em>She’s</em> the stick. And I tell
you people don’t like it, mother. It’s not what we
pay our professors <em>for</em>. Peyton used to be perfectly
satisfied with civilization. But now he talks about
society. Makes light remarks.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span></p>

<p>I should say that was going out of his way to be
disagreeable. What business has a professor of English
to say anything about society? It’s not in his
department.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Root</span></p>

<p>I told Peyton he should be more systematic.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span></p>

<p>How did this gypsy get here?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Root</span></p>

<p>She was brought up by a family named Mason.
But it seems she was a gypsy child, who got lost or
something, and those Masons took her in. I’m sure
it was very good of them, and it’s too bad they weren’t
able to make her more of a Christian. She is coming
to have a following in the university! There are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
people who seem to think that because you’re outside
society you have some superior information about it.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span></p>

<p>Well, don’t you think you’re needlessly disturbed?
In my day, a young man would be likely enough to
fall in love with a good-looking gypsy, not very likely
to marry her.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Root</span></p>

<p>Times have changed, mother. They marry them
now. [<em>Both sigh.</em>] Of course, it’s very commendable
of them.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span></p>

<p>[<em>Grimly.</em>] Oh, quite&mdash;commendable.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Root</span></p>

<p>I was brought up in university circles. I’m interested
in <em>ideas</em>. But sometimes I think there are too
<em>many</em> ideas.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span></p>

<p>An embarrassment of riches. So you have set out
to civilize the young woman?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Root</span></p>

<p>I’d rather have her sit at my table than have my
son leave some morning in a covered wagon!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span></p>

<p>I wonder how it is about gypsies. About the children.
I wonder if it’s as it is with the negroes.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Root</span></p>

<p><em>Mother!</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span></p>

<p>It would be startling, wouldn’t it?&mdash;if one of them
should turn out to be a real gypsy and take to this
open road.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Root</span></p>

<p>[<em>Covering her face.</em>] Oh!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span></p>

<p>Quite likely they’d do it by motor.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Root</span></p>

<p>[<em>Rising.</em>] Mother!&mdash;how can you say such dreadful
things&mdash;and just when I have this <em>trying</em> dinner.
Oh, I wish Bessie would come! [<em>Goes to the window.</em>]
She is a comfort to me.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span></p>

<p>Where is Bessie?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Root</span></p>

<p>She’s away in the motor. [<em>Again shudders.</em>]
Bessie feels dreadfully about her brother. She is trying
to do something. She said it would be a surprise&mdash;a
happy surprise. [<em>Someone heard in the hall.</em>]
Perhaps this is Bessie. [<em>Enter <span class="smcap">Mr. Peyton</span>.</em>] Oh,
it’s Uncle George.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Uncle George</span></p>

<p>Early I know. Came to have a little visit with
Elizabeth. [<em>Goes to <span class="smcap">Grandmother</span> and shakes
hands.</em>] How are you, young woman?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span></p>

<p>My nerves seem to be stronger than the nerves I see
around me. And how are you, George?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Uncle George</span></p>

<p>Oh, I’m <em>well</em>.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span></p>

<p>But&mdash;?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Uncle George</span></p>

<p>Responsibilities.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span></p>

<p>The bank?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Uncle George</span></p>

<p>I’d rather run ten banks than a tenth of a university.
You can control money.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Root</span></p>

<p>I’m sorry, Uncle George, that Peyton should be
adding to your worries.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Uncle George</span></p>

<p>What’s the matter with Peyton?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span></p>

<p>Wild oats.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Uncle George</span></p>

<p>Well, I wish he’d sow them in less intellectual fields.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Root</span></p>

<p>I am prepared to speak freely with you, Uncle
George. The matter with Peyton is this girl. Well,
they’re going to be married. Yes [<em>Answering his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"><span class="normalfont">[74]</span></a></span>
gesture of protest</em>] and I think it’s a good thing. She
won’t be in a position to say so much about freedom
after she is married.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Uncle George</span></p>

<p>But they say she’s a gypsy.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Root</span></p>

<p>She won’t be a gypsy after she’s Peyton’s wife.
She’ll be a married woman.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Uncle George</span></p>

<p>Yes, but in the meantime we will have swallowed
a gypsy.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span></p>

<p>And I was just wondering how it would be about
the children.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Root</span></p>

<p>Mother, please don’t be indelicate again.</p>

<p class="sd">[<em>Pause.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span></p>

<p>Well, if there’s nothing else we may speak of, let’s

<p>From clue to clue I worked my way to Sunny Center.
I would say to myself&mdash;Do this for Peyton;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
do this for Jhansi. And so, I heard of an old minister
who had been there years and years. I went to
him and&mdash;he had married Jhansi’s father and mother!
Dearest child, your mother taught in his Sunday-School!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Senator Byrd</span></p>

<p>You see Jhansi’s mother and father&mdash;her real ones&mdash;died
of typhoid fever before she was two years old.
They got it from the cows. Well, the Harrisons were
friends of the Mason’s&mdash;they all worked together in
the church&mdash;and so they took Jhansi, and soon after
that they moved away and we lost track of them. You
know what a busy world it is&mdash;particularly for people

<h2>THE OUTSIDE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <em>A room in a house which was once a life-saving
station. Since ceasing to be that it has taken
on no other character, except that of a place which
no one cares either to preserve or change. It is
painted the life-saving gray, but has not the life-saving
freshness. This is one end of what was the big boat
room, and at the ceiling is seen a part of the frame
work from which the boat once swung. About two
thirds of the back wall is open, because of the big
sliding door, of the type of barn door, and through
this open door are seen the sand dunes, and beyond
them the woods. At one point the line where woods
and dunes meet stands out clearly and there are indicated
the rude things, vines, bushes, which form the
outer uneven rim of the woods&mdash;the only things that
grow in the sand. At another point a sand-hill is
menacing the woods. This old life-saving station is
at a point where the sea curves, so through the open
door the sea also is seen.</em> [<em>The station is located on
the outside shore of Cape Cod, at the point, near the
tip of the Cape, where it makes that final curve which
forms the Provincetown Harbor.</em>] <em>The dunes are
hills and strange forms of sand on which, in places,
grows the stiff beach grass&mdash;struggle; dogged growing
against odds. At right of the big sliding door is a
drift of sand and the top of buried beach grass is
seen on this. There is a door left, and at right of big
sliding door is a slanting wall. Door in this is ajar
at rise of curtain, and through this door <span class="smcap">Bradford</span>
and <span class="smcap">Tony</span>, life-savers, are seen bending over a man’s
body, attempting to restore respiration. The captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"><span class="normalfont">[100]</span></a></span>
of the life-savers comes into view outside the big open
door, at left; he appears to have been hurrying, peers
in, sees the men, goes quickly to them.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Captain</span></p>

<p>I’ll take this now, boys.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Bradford</span></p>

or later. I wouldn’t say it of many Portagees. But
the sea [<em>Calling it in to the <span class="smcap">Captain</span></em>] is friendly as a
kitten alongside the women that live <em>here</em>. Allie Mayo&mdash;they’re
<em>both</em> crazy&mdash;had that door open [<em>Moving
his head toward the big sliding door</em>] sweepin’ out,
and when we come along she backs off and stands
lookin’ at us, <em>lookin’</em>&mdash;Lord, I just wanted to get him
somewhere else. So I kicked this door open with my
foot [<em>Jerking his hand toward the room where the
<span class="smcap">Captain</span> is seen bending over the man</em>] and got him
<em>away</em>. [<em>Under his voice.</em>] If he did have any notion
of comin’ back to life, he wouldn’t a come if he’d
seen her. [<em>More genially.</em>] <em>I</em> wouldn’t.</p>

<p>Well, <em>I</em> was here before. [<em>A laugh.</em>] And the old
man&mdash;[<em>Nodding toward the <span class="smcap">Captain</span></em>] he lived here
for twenty-seven years. Lord, the things that happened
<em>here</em>. There’ve been dead ones carried through
<em>that</em> door. [<em>Pointing to the outside door.</em>] Lord&mdash;the
ones <em>I’ve</em> carried. I carried in Bill Collins, and
Lou Harvey and&mdash;huh! ’sall over now. You ain’t

here the night the Jennie Snow was out there. [<em>Pointing

bank. [<em>Goes to the door and looks out.</em>] Lord, how’d
we ever do it? The sand has put this place on the
blink all right. And then when it gets too God-forsaken
for a life-savin’ station, a lady takes it for a
summer residence&mdash;and then spends the winter.
She’s cheerful one.</p>

over to the sand&mdash;huh! This Patrick woman used to
be all right. She and her husband was summer folks
over in town. They used to picnic over here on the
outside. It was Joe Dyer&mdash;he’s always talkin’ to
summer folks&mdash;told ’em the government was goin’ to
build the new station and sell this one by sealed bids.
I heard them talkin’ about it. They was sittin’ right
down there on the beach, eatin’ their supper. They
was goin’ to put in a fire-place and they was goin’ to
paint it bright colors, and have parties over here&mdash;summer
folk notions. Their bid won it&mdash;who’d want
it?&mdash;a buried house you couldn’t move.</p>

<p>Don’t you? How astonishin’! You must be color
blind. And I guess <em>we’re</em> the first party. [<em>Laughs.</em>]
I was in Bill Joseph’s grocery store, one day last
November, when in she comes&mdash;Mrs. Patrick, from
New York. “I’ve come to take the old life-saving
station,” says she. “I’m going to sleep over there
tonight!” Huh! Bill is used to queer ways&mdash;he
deals with summer folks, but that got <em>him</em>. November&mdash;an
empty house, a buried house, you might say, off
here on the outside shore&mdash;way across the sand from
man or beast. He got it out of her, not by what she
said, but by the way she looked at what he said, that her
husband had died, and she was runnin’ off to hide herself,
I guess. A person’d feel sorry for her if she
weren’t so stand-offish, and so doggon <em>mean</em>. But
mean folks have got minds of their own. She slept
here that night. Bill had men hauling things till after
dark&mdash;bed, stove, coal. And then she wanted somebody
to work for her. “Somebody,” says she, “that
doesn’t say an unnecessary word!” Well, when Bill
come to the back of the store, I said, “Looks to me
as if Allie Mayo was the party she’s lookin’ for.”
Allie Mayo has got a prejudice against words. Or
maybe she likes ’em so well she’s savin’ of ’em. She’s
not spoke an unnecessary word for twenty years.
She’s got her reasons. Women whose men go to sea
ain’t always talkative.</p>

<p>Well&mdash;yes; sometimes when I’m tired I might
like to slump back into it. You see honor camouflages
so many things&mdash;stupidity, selfishness&mdash;greed, lust,
avarice, gluttony. So without it you’re almost forced
to be a decent sort&mdash;and that’s sometimes wearing.
[<em>In another voice.</em>] But I’ll tell you why I’m really
here! When men begin to sob around about woman’s
honor they get my goat. That lawyer&mdash;he thought
he was going to get away with it. Why, woman’s
honor would have died out long ago if it hadn’t been
for men’s talk about it.</p>

<p>That man&mdash;the one when I was seventeen&mdash;<em>he’s</em>

Wallace, is much moved by your generosity. He had
made up his mind to die for woman’s honor. Now it
seems he is not to do so&mdash;a change of plan to which
he has not yet adjusted himself. His perturbation
makes him unequal to selecting the lady who was with
him on the night of October 25. [<em>Door swings,
<span class="smcap">Prisoner</span> looks around nervously.</em>] So&mdash;I would
like to get your feeling. Since it seems unnecessary
for all of you to have been with the young man on the
night of October 25&mdash;</p>

<p>Now, doubtless you will agree with me that we
should always eliminate waste. If a woman’s honor is
to be sacrificed, may I without indelicacy inquire who
would sacrifice least?</p>

I’ve been cheated. Cheated out of my chance to have
a man I wanted by a man who would have what he
wanted. Then he saved my woman’s honor. Married
me and cheated me out of my life. I’m just
something to be cheated. That’s the way I think of
myself. Until this morning. Until I read about Gordon
Wallace. Then I saw a way to get away from
myself. It’s the first thing I ever wanted to do that
I’ve done. You’ll not cheat me out of this. Don’t

<h2>BERNICE</h2>


<h3>ACT ONE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <em>The living-room of Bernice’s house in the
country. You feel yourself in the house of a woman
you would like to know, a woman of sure and beautiful
instincts, who lives simply. At the spectator’s right,
stairs go up from the living room; back of this&mdash;right,
rear, a door; to the front of the stairs is a narrowed
passage as of a hall leading to the kitchen. On
the other side of the room, is a tea-table before the
fireplace, and before it is a low rounded chair, as if
awaiting the one who will come to serve tea. Toward
the rear of this left wall is a door. This door is closed.
From the back of the room French windows lead directly
out of doors. On each side of this door is a
window thus opening almost the entire wall to the
October woods. There are comfortable seats under
the windows, books about. It is late afternoon and
the sun glows through the flaming leaves. As the
curtain is drawn the <span class="smcap">Father</span> is seen sitting at a long
table at the side of the stairway, playing solitaire.
At the back of the cards, open books are propped
against the wall, and papers on which he has been
writing. <span class="smcap">Abbie</span>, a middle-aged servant, is attending
to the open fire.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>[<em>Holding up a card he is about to place.</em>] Ten
minutes since the train whistled. They’ll be here in
five minutes now.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>It will be hard for Craig to come in this house,
Abbie.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>Oh, yes.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>Bernice made this house. [<em>Looking around.</em>]
Everything is Bernice. [<em>A pause.</em>] Change something,
Abbie! [<em>With growing excitement.</em>] Put
something in a different place. [<em>He takes a pillow
from the seat under the window, holds it irresolutely
a moment, puts it on the floor at the side of the fireplace.
On the other side he moves a high vase from
the window. Then helplessly.</em>] Well, I don’t know.
You can’t get Bernice out of this room. The tea-table!
Come, Abbie, quick! We will take this <em>out</em>
of the room. [<em>Together, <span class="smcap">Abbie</span> reluctant, they move
it to the passage-way leading out from the living-room.
The <span class="smcap">Father</span> comes back and sees the chair, now without
its table. He goes as if to move it, but cannot
do this; looks old and broken as he faces the closed
door.</em>] I wish they’d left Bernice upstairs, Abbie,
in her own room. Now <em>there</em>&mdash;so near the living-room&mdash;right
off the living-room. [<em>Hastily goes back
to his cards, but in an instant he brushes them together
and pulls the open book toward him, and papers; but
he only rests his hand on the book.</em>] There’ll be only
Craig and his sister on this train, Abbie.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>That’s all I know of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>But Margaret Pierce will be here soon. As soon
as she can get here, Margaret will come. Within an
hour, probably.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>[<em>Apprehensive.</em>] You think so, sir?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>I think so. That train from the West got to the
Junction at three. I have a feeling Margaret won’t
wait for the five o’clock train to get here. She’ll get
a car. [<em><span class="smcap">Abbie</span> goes to the door and looks out.</em>] It
would save a little time, and&mdash;she doesn’t know that
Bernice&mdash;Yes, Margaret will get here the quickest
way. She always came to Bernice when Bernice
needed her.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>She doesn’t need anyone now.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>No. But yes&mdash;in a way, she does. She needs
some one to be here to do what she can’t go on doing.
Margaret will see that&mdash;when she knows. Margaret
sees everything.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>[<em>Frightened now.</em>] You think so, sir?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>Oh, yes, she does. Bernice knew that. “Margaret
sees things,” I’ve heard Bernice say. [<em><span class="smcap">Abbie</span> turns
from him.</em>] Now Mrs. Kirby, Craig’s sister Laura,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
she’s a sensible woman, she’ll be a help to you, Abbie,
in&mdash;arranging things. But see things? No. How
different people are. They’re all different, Abbie. I
don’t think Bernice cared much for Laura&mdash;though
she didn’t mind her. She’d just laugh about Laura&mdash;about
her being so sure of everything. It was nice,
Abbie, the way Bernice would just laugh about things.
She had no malice.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>[<em>Strangely intense.</em>] No. She didn’t have, did
she?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>Oh, no, Abbie. Malice wasn’t in her. It was just
that a good many things&mdash;well, the things that are
important to most people weren’t so important to
Bernice. It was another set of things were important.
People called her detached. But&mdash;I don’t know.
Maybe <em>they’re</em> detached, Abbie. Maybe it’s Laura
Kirby, the sensible woman, who’s detached,&mdash;Bernice
would have laughed at that&mdash;the practical person
who’s detached, and Bernice.... You know what
I mean, Abbie?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>I think I do&mdash;knowing her.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>To you&mdash;did she seem detached?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>[<em>Tenderly thinking it out.</em>] She was loving, and
thoughtful, and gay. But always a little of what she
is now&mdash;[<em>Faces the closed door</em>] off by herself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
[<em>With that intensity the present moment does not account
for.</em>] You can’t expect to understand a person
who is “off by herself.” Now can you?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>I understood Bernice. Except, there were things&mdash;outside
what I understood.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>[<em>Eagerly.</em>] That’s it. And we should take what
<em>we</em> had, shouldn’t we, and not try to reach into&mdash;to
where we didn’t go.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>I suppose that’s true, Abbie. [<em>Buries his face.</em>]
I wish my little girl hadn’t died. What am I going
to do, Abbie? How can I stay here? And how can
I go away? We should die in our proper order; I
should have gone before my daughter. Anything else
makes confusion. There’s not going to be anybody to
laugh at me now, Abbie. I’ll miss the way Bernice
laughed at me, a laugh that took me in and&mdash;yes, took
me in. She laughed at my spending the whole time
of the war studying Sanscrit. Well, why shouldn’t
I? What can the old do about war? I had my vision
of life. If that had been followed there’d have been
no war. But in a world that won’t have visions&mdash;why
not study Sanscrit while such a world is being
made over&mdash;into another such world. [<em>Listening.</em>]
You hear some one, Abbie?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>[<em>After listening.</em>] It didn’t turn in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>And you, Abbie. [<em>With wonder.</em>] Why you were
with us when Bernice was born.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>Yes, I was&mdash;in the room the night she was born.
The night she died I thought of the night she was
born.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>That was&mdash;how long ago, Abbie?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>Thirty-five years ago.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>Was Bernice thirty-five years old? She <em>was</em>, Abbie&mdash;my
little girl? Well, life moves by&mdash;and we
hardly know it’s moving. Why, Abbie, your whole
life has been lived around Bernice. [<em><span class="smcap">Abbie</span> nods.</em>]
It will be now as if things had&mdash;fallen apart. And
it was the main thing in your life&mdash;doing things for
her.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>[<em>With excitement.</em>] Yes, it was the <em>main</em> thing in
my life&mdash;doing what she wanted. I couldn’t do anything
else now, could I?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>[<em>A little surprised at her agitation, but not thinking
about it.</em>] Why, no. Now some one is coming, Abbie.
You hear them coming?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>I think so. [<em>She goes to the door.</em>] Yes.</p>

<p class="sd">[<em><span class="smcap">Abbie</span> opens the door and <span class="smcap">Laura</span> and
<span class="smcap">Craig</span> come in. <span class="smcap">Craig</span> holds back

he can scarcely make himself do;
he does not look around the room.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Laura</span></p>

<p>[<em>To the <span class="smcap">Father</span>, taking his hand.</em>] This is so hard
for you, Mr. Allen. I cannot tell you&mdash;[<em>Turning to
<span class="smcap">Abbie</span></em>] Abbie.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>[<em>Going to <span class="smcap">Craig</span>, who is still at the door.</em>] Well,
Craig. [<em>The <span class="smcap">Father</span> holds out his hand, <span class="smcap">Craig</span> takes
it.</em>] Well, I don’t know what we’re going to do without
her.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Laura</span></p>

<p>[<em>Coming to the rescue with the practical.</em>] And
where are you going to put us, Abbie?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>I have the rooms ready upstairs.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>[<em>As if he cannot do this.</em>] Upstairs?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>[<em>In a low voice.</em>] She is down here, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p class="sd">[<em>She indicates the closed door. Then

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Laura</span></p>

<p>[<em>On the stairway.</em>] Aren’t you coming up, Craig, to
get clean and rest a little?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>In a minute or two. [<em>He sits down&mdash;on the edge
of a chair near the door. The <span class="smcap">Father</span> and husband
sit there silent.</em>] Bernice&mdash;hadn’t been sick long, had
she?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>No, it was very sudden. You know she had had
trouble occasionally in the past year; Dr. Willis had
said she might have to go to the hospital. At first
this seemed like that&mdash;so Abbie and I weren’t really
alarmed. Of course we sent for Willis, but he was in
Boston. Young Stuart had the grip. So there was no
doctor here&mdash;till afterwards.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>And&mdash;how long was Bernice sick?</p>

<p class="sd">[<em>He speaks with difficulty.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>She spoke of feeling badly on Tuesday. She was
lying down most of that day. Wednesday&mdash;she didn’t
get up at all Wednesday. And she died late Wednesday
night. [<em>Emotion breaking through.</em>] Abbie and
I were here all alone!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>Did she say&mdash;Did she leave&mdash;Well, we can
talk of that later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>[<em>Changing to something not so hard to speak of.</em>]
You landed last week?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>Yes, I was held in New York by things to do. [<em>A
glance at the <span class="smcap">Father</span>.</em>] Of course, if I had had any
idea&mdash;</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>Of course.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>But Bernice wrote me she was fine.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>She seemed so. She was well and&mdash;seemed very
happy here this fall. You know how she loves to
tramp the woods in the fall. She was counting on
your coming home. She had done over your room
upstairs. And hers too. They both look so nice and
fresh. And she was just starting to do some things
to Margaret’s room. Margaret was coming next
month for a rest. She’s been working very hard.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>Are you expecting Margaret now?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>Yes. Wednesday evening Bernice seemed to want
Margaret to come. She thought maybe Margaret
could get away now, and that it would do her good too.
She had been worrying about her&mdash;thinking she was
working too hard. Margaret’s been in Chicago, you
know, working on some labor things&mdash;I never know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
just what it is she is doing. Bernice seemed to want
to see her. I wonder if Bernice herself felt it was
more than we knew. Anyway, she wanted us to send
for Margaret.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>But you didn’t send for me until&mdash;until it was over.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>No. You see we didn’t know&mdash;Abbie and I didn’t
have any idea&mdash;I spoke of sending for you when we
sent the telegram for Margaret, but Bernice said you’d
be here soon anyway, and she didn’t want to hurry you
away from New York. [<em>As if not understanding it
himself, and trying to find an explanation.</em>] I suppose
you were doing something that she knew about, and
didn’t want to interrupt.</p>

<p class="sd">[<em><span class="smcap">Craig</span> half looks at him.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>And Margaret answered that she was coming?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>Yes, we heard from her Thursday morning that
she had started. She could get here today. We didn’t
know where to reach her telling her it was too late now
for&mdash;for the visit with Bernice. [<em>Breaking.</em>] I just
can’t believe it! Think of what you and I are talking
about! Bernice, <em>out</em> of life. She was so&mdash;<em>of</em> it.

out on Long Island with them while I was attending
to some things about my work. I had a beautiful
letter from Bernice. She was perfectly all right&mdash;about
everything. And I was anxious now to get
home to her. I was getting ready to start the very
day I got the telegram that&mdash;that it was like this.
You mean&mdash;you think I didn’t make Bernice happy,
Margaret?</p>

<p>Yes, that’s it. Something you couldn’t destroy. A

her. That&mdash;that makes a difference, Margaret. I
never <em>had</em> Bernice.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>It’s inconceivable that she should&mdash;cut off her own
life. In her lived all the life that was behind her.
You felt that in her&mdash;so wonderfully. She felt it
in herself&mdash;or her eyes couldn’t have been like that.
<em>Could</em> they? Could they, Abbie?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>It&mdash;wouldn’t seem so.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>She wouldn’t destroy so <em>much</em>. Why she never
destroyed anything&mdash;a flower&mdash;a caterpillar. Don’t
you see what I mean, Abbie? This denies so <em>much</em>.
And then is it true that all this time she wasn’t happy?
Why she seemed happy&mdash;as trees grow. Did Mr.
Norris make her unhappy? Oh, don’t think you
shouldn’t talk about it. Don’t act as if I shouldn’t
ask. It’s too big for those little scruples. Abbie!
I can’t let Bernice’s life go out in darkness. So tell
me&mdash;just what happened&mdash;each little thing. [<em><span class="smcap">Margaret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></span>

<p>Margaret, what is to be gained in making people feel

<p>Of course not. None of us can be that. But I

<p>That comes easily from the person who’s bearing

<p>Your brother has lost his wife! That’s all <em>you</em> see
in it!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Laura</span></p>

<p>I don’t see why you seem so wild&mdash;so resentful,
Margaret. Death should soften us.</p>

<p class="sd">[<em>She takes her old place before the fire.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Well I can tell you this doesn’t soften me!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Laura</span></p>

<p>I see that you feel hard toward Craig. But Bernice
didn’t. You think he should have come right home.
But you must be just enough to admit he didn’t have
any idea Bernice was going to be taken suddenly sick.
He had been out of the country for three months,
naturally there were things connected with his writing
to see about.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Connected with his writing! Laura! Don’t <em>lie</em>
about life with death in the next room. If you want
to talk at a time like this, have the decency to be
honest! Try to see the <em>truth</em> about living. Craig
stayed in New York with May Fredericks&mdash;and he
doesn’t pretend anything else. Stayed there with May
Fredericks, continuing an affair that has been going on
for the past year. And before it was May Fredericks
it was this one and that one. Well, all right. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
may be all right. I’m not condemning Craig for his
affairs. I’m condemning you for the front you’re
trying to put up!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Laura</span></p>

<p>I certainly am not trying to put up any front. It’s
merely that there seems nothing to be gained in speaking
of certain things. If Craig was&mdash;really unfaithful,
I do condemn him for that. I haven’t your liberal
ideas. [<em>Slight pause, she takes up her knitting.</em>] It’s
unfortunate Bernice hadn’t the power to hold Craig.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Hadn’t the power to hold Craig!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Laura</span></p>

<p>She didn’t want to&mdash;I suppose your scoffing means.
Well, she should have wanted to. It’s what a wife
should want to do.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Oh, Laura, Bernice will never say one more word
for herself! In there. Alone. Still. She will not
do one new thing to&mdash;to throw a light back on other
things. That’s death. A <em>leaving</em> of one’s life. Leaving
it&mdash;with us. I cannot talk to you about what
Bernice “should have been.” What she was came
true and deep from&mdash;[<em>Throwing out her hands as
if giving up saying it. Taking it up again.</em>] It’s true
there was something in her Craig did not control.
Something he couldn’t <em>mess up</em>. There was something
in her he might have drawn from and become bigger
than he was. But he’s vain. He has to be bowling
some one over all the time&mdash;to show that he has <em>power</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Laura</span></p>

<p>I don’t agree with you that Craig is especially vain.
He’s a man. He does want to affect&mdash;yes, dominate
the woman he loves. And if Bernice didn’t give him
that feeling of&mdash;</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Supremacy.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Laura</span></p>

<p>There’s no use trying to talk with you of personal
things. Certainly I don’t want to quarrel tonight.
That would not be the thing. [<em>In a new tone.</em>] How
is your work going? I don’t quite know what you
are doing now, but trying to get some one out of prison,
I suppose?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Yes; I am trying to get out of prison all those
people who are imprisoned for ideas.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Laura</span></p>

<p>I see.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>I doubt if you see, Laura.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Laura</span></p>

<p>Well I don’t say I sympathize. But I see.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>No; for if you did see, you would have to sympathize.
If you did see, you would be ashamed; you
would have to&mdash;hang your head for this thing of
locking any man up because of what his mind sees. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
thinking is not to become&mdash;whatever thinking may
become!&mdash;then why are we here at all? [<em>She stops
and thinks of it.</em>] Why does Bernice&mdash;her death&mdash;make
that so simple tonight? Because she was
herself. She had the gift for being herself. And she
wanted each one to have the chance to be himself.
Anything else hurt her&mdash;as it hurt her to see a dog
tied, or a child at a narrow window.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Laura</span></p>

<p>I don’t think Bernice was a very good wife for a
writer.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>She would have been a wonderful wife for a real
writer.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Laura</span></p>

<p>Oh, I know she didn’t value Craig’s work. And
that’s another thing. And I suppose you don’t value
it either. [<em>She looks at <span class="smcap">Margaret</span>, who does not
speak.</em>] Fortunately there are many thousands of people
in this country who do value it. And I suppose
you think what I do of little value too. I suppose
you scoff at those things we do to put cripples back
in life.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>No, Laura, I don’t scoff at anything that can be
done for cripples. Since men have been crippled,
cripples must be helped. I only say&mdash;Don’t cripple
minds&mdash;strong free minds that might go&mdash;we know
not where! Might go into places where the light of
a mind has never been. [<em>Rising.</em>] Think of it!
Think of that chance of making life even greater than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
death. [<em>With passion.</em>] If you have any respect for
life&mdash;any reverence&mdash;you have to leave the mind
free. I do not scoff at you, but you are not a serious
person. You have no faith&mdash;no hope&mdash;no self-respect!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Laura</span></p>

<p>[<em>Rising.</em>] <em>You</em> tell me I have no self-respect! You
who have not cared what people thought of you&mdash;who
have not had the sense of fitness&mdash;the taste&mdash;to
hold the place you were born to&mdash;you tell me,
against whom no word was ever spoken, that I have
no self-respect?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>You have a blameless reputation, Laura. You have
no self-respect. If you had any respect for your own
mind you could not be willing to limit the mind of any
other. If you had any respect for your own spiritual
life you could not be willing to push <em>your</em> self into
the spiritual life of another. [<em>Roughly.</em>] No!
You could not. [<em>As one seeing far.</em>] I see it as I
never saw it. Oh I wish I could talk to Bernice!
Something is <em>down</em>. I could see things as I never
saw them.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Laura</span></p>

<p>[<em>Gathering up the things she had been working
with.</em>] I will go before I am insulted further.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>There’s nothing insulting in trying to find the truth.
[<em>Impulsively reaching out her hands to <span class="smcap">Laura</span>, as she

<p>It’s hard tonight.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>[<em>Intensely.</em>] But perhaps it is tonight or not at all.
It’s a strange thing this has done. A light trying
to find its way through a fog. [<em>In her mind the light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"><span class="normalfont">[198]</span></a></span>
tries to do this.</em>] Craig, why do you write the things
you do?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>Oh, Margaret, is this any time to talk of work?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>It seems to be. Tonight it’s all part of the same
thing. Laura and I were talking of work&mdash;quarreling
about it: you were talking of Bernice’s father.
The light&mdash;just goes there. That poor sad old man&mdash;why
didn’t he go on? You said he was a wreck of
the Darwinian theory. Then me&mdash;a wreck of free
speech.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>Oh I didn’t mean you were, Margaret.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>But I might be. I can see that. We give ourselves
in fighting for a thing that seems important and
in that fight we get out of the flow of life. We had
meant it to deepen the flow&mdash;but we get caught. I
know people like that. People who get at home in
their fight&mdash;and stay there&mdash;and are left there when
the fight’s over&mdash;like this old man. How many nights
Bernice and I have sat in this room and talked of
things! And I had thought&mdash;[<em>With sudden angry
passion.</em>] If you had been good to her, she would
be in this room now. [<em>After a look at him.</em>] I’m
sorry. But can I help feeling it?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>I didn’t know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>No; you didn’t know. We don’t know. When you
think what a writer might do for life&mdash;for we <em>don’t</em>
know. You write so well, Craig, but&mdash;what of it?
What is it is the matter with you&mdash;with all you
American writers&mdash;’most all of you. A well-put-up
light&mdash;but it doesn’t penetrate anything. It never
makes the fog part. Just shows itself off&mdash;a well-put-up
light. [<em>Growing angry.</em>] It would be better
if we didn’t have you at all! Can’t you see that it
would? Lights which&mdash;only light themselves keep
us from having light&mdash;from knowing what the darkness
is. [<em>After thinking.</em>] Craig, as you write these
things are there never times when you sit there <em>dumb</em>
and know that you are glib and empty?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>Did you ever try to write, Margaret?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>I suppose you think it’s very simple to be real. I
suppose you think we could do it&mdash;if we just wanted
to do it. Try it. You try.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>So you do this just to cover the fact that you <em>can’t</em>
do anything? Your skill&mdash;a mask for your lack
of power?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>I should think you’d want to be good to me tonight,
Margaret.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Be good to you! Keep you from seeing. That’s
the way we’re good to each other. There’s only one
thing I could do for you tonight, Craig. You don’t
want that. So&mdash;</p>

<p class="sd">[<em>Moves as if to rise.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>No, don’t go away. My brain won’t keep still either.
What I think is just as bad as what you say. Well,
why do you think it is I&mdash;miss things&mdash;never get
anywhere?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>I don’t know. And it’s true of all of us. Of me
too. I do things that to me seem important, and yet
I just do <em>them</em>&mdash;I don’t get to the thing I’m doing
them for&mdash;to life itself. I don’t simply and profoundly
get to <em>life</em>. Bernice did.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>Yes. Bernice did.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>And yet you had to&mdash;shy away from Bernice. Into
a smaller world that could be all your world. No,
Craig, you haven’t power. It’s true. And for one
hour in our lives let’s try to&mdash;Those love affairs of
yours&mdash;they’re like your false writing&mdash;to keep
yourself from knowing you haven’t power. Did you
ever see a child try to do a thing&mdash;fail&mdash;then turn
to something he could do and make a great show of
doing that? That’s what most of our lives are like.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>[<em>Rudely.</em>] Well, why <em>haven’t</em> I power? If you are
going to be any good to me&mdash;tell me that.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>[<em>Shaking her head.</em>] I can’t tell you that. I
haven’t any light that&mdash;goes there. But isn’t it true?
Isn’t your life this long attempt to appear effective&mdash;to
persuade yourself that you <em>are</em> something? What
a way to spend the little time there is for living.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>I fancy it’s the way most lives are spent.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>That only makes it infinitely sadder.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>[<em>As if he can stay in this no longer.</em>] As to writing,
Margaret, the things that interest you wouldn’t
interest most people.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>“Wouldn’t interest most people!” Oh, Craig, don’t
slide away from that one honest moment. Say you
haven’t got it. Don’t say they wouldn’t want it.
Why, if now&mdash;in this our day&mdash;our troubled day of
many shadows&mdash;came a light&mdash;a light to reach those
never lighted places&mdash;wouldn’t <em>want</em> it? I wish
some one could try them! No, Craig, they all have
their times of suspecting their lives are going by in a
fog. They’re <em>pitifully</em> anxious for a little light.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
Why&mdash;they continue to look to <em>writers</em>. You know,
Craig, what living makes of us&mdash;it’s a rim&mdash;a
bounded circle&mdash;and yet we know&mdash;have our times
of suspecting&mdash;that if we could break through <em>that</em>.
[<em>Seeing.</em>] O-h. It’s like living in the mountains&mdash;those
high vast places of Colorado&mdash;in a little house
with shaded windows. You’d <em>suspect</em> what was there!
A little sunshine through the cracks&mdash;mountain smells&mdash;and
at times the house would shake&mdash;and you’d
wonder&mdash;and be fretted in your little room. And if
some day you could put up the shade and&mdash;<em>see where
you were</em>. Life would never be so small a thing again.
Bernice could do that. Her own life did not bound
her.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>No. That was what&mdash;</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Hurt your vanity?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>I don’t know. I’m trying to be honest. I honestly
don’t know.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>No. We don’t know. That’s why&mdash;oh, Craig, it
would be so wonderful to be a writer&mdash;something
that gets a little farther than others can get&mdash;gets
at least the edge of the shadow. [<em>After her own
moment on the edge of the shadow.</em>] If you ever
felt the shock of reality, and <em>got</em> that back in you&mdash;you
wouldn’t be thinking of whom it would “interest”!
But, Craig&mdash;<em>this</em>. [<em>A movement toward the closed
room.</em>] Doesn’t <em>this</em> give you that shock of reality?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>What of <em>you</em>? Doesn’t it give it to you? You’re
speaking as if this hadn’t happened! You leave it
out&mdash;what Bernice did because of me. You’re talking
of my having no power. What of <em>this</em>? <em>Had</em>
I no power? [<em>After her look at him.</em>] Oh, yes&mdash;I
know I used it terribly&mdash;plenty of years for my
heart to break over that. But can you say I didn’t
<em>have</em> it?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>I do leave it out. It isn’t right there should be
anything in Bernice not Bernice. And she had a great
rightness&mdash;rightness without effort&mdash;that rare, rare
thing.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>You say it isn’t right&mdash;and so you leave it out?
And then <em>you</em> talk about the shock of reality.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>I don’t say it isn’t fact. I say it isn’t&mdash;<em>in the
rightness</em>.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>“In the rightness!” Is that for you to say? Is
rightness what you think? What you can see? No.
You didn’t know Bernice. You didn’t know she loved
me&mdash;<em>that way</em>. And I didn’t know. But she did!
How <em>could</em> I have had that&mdash;and not <em>known</em>? But
I <em>did</em> have it! I did <em>have</em> it! You say life broke
through her&mdash;the whole of life. But Bernice didn’t
want&mdash;the whole of life. She wanted <em>me</em>. [<em>He goes
to the door, bows against it, all sorrow and need.</em>]<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
I want to talk to <em>her</em>&mdash;not you. I want her <em>now</em>&mdash;<em>knowing</em>.</p>

<p class="sd">[<em>He opens that door and goes in to Bernice.

<p>Didn’t do it? Did <em>not</em> take her own life?</p>

<p>No. Of course she didn’t.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>Because she said I must. Oh&mdash;look at me! Look

have done it too</em>. You would!</p>

<p>[<em>Saying each word by itself.</em>] I can not understand

you. [<em>Changing, and roughly taking hold of <span class="smcap">Abbie</span>.</em>]

<p>Wednesday night, about eight o’clock, about an hour
after she told me to telegraph you, she said, “Why,
Abbie, I believe I’m going to die.” I said no, but she
said, “I think so.” I said we’d send for Mr. Norris.
She said no, and not to frighten her father. I&mdash;<em>I</em>
didn’t think she was going to die. All the time I was
trying to get the doctor. There were two hours when
she was&mdash;quiet. Quiet&mdash;not like any quiet I ever
knew. Thinking. You could see thinking in her eyes&mdash;stronger
than sickness. Then, after ten, she called
me to her. She took my hands. She said, “Abbie,
you’ve lived with me all my life.” “Yes,” I said.
“You love me.” “Oh, yes,” I said. “Will you do
something for me?” “You know I will,” I told her.
“Abbie,” she said, looking right at me, <em>all</em> of her
looking right at me, “if I die, I want you to tell my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
husband I killed myself.” [<em><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> falls back.</em>]
Yes, I did that too. Then I thought it was her mind.
But I looked at her, and oh, her mind was there! It
was terrible&mdash;how it was all <em>there</em>. She said&mdash;and
then she [<em>The sobs she has been holding back almost
keep <span class="smcap">Abbie</span> from saying this</em>]&mdash;held out her hands to
me&mdash;“Oh, Abbie, do this last thing for me! After
all there has been, I have a <em>right</em> to do it. If my life is
going&mdash;let me have <em>this</em> much from it!” And as still
I couldn’t&mdash;<em>couldn’t</em>&mdash;the tears ran down her face
and she said, “I want to rest before pain comes again.
Promise me so I can rest.” And I promised. And
you would have too!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>You don’t know what you’re <em>telling</em> me! You don’t
know <em>what</em> you’re doing. You do this <em>now</em>&mdash;after
she can do nothing? [<em>Holding out her hands.</em>]
Abbie! Tell me it isn’t true!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>It’s true.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>You are telling me her life was <em>hate</em>? [<em>Stops, half

<h3>ACT THREE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <em>The same as in Acts One and Two; it is
early afternoon of the next day; the door leading outdoors
is a little open; when the curtain is drawn <span class="smcap">Craig</span>
is seen outside, just passing the window, as one who
is walking back and forth in thinking. In the room
are <span class="smcap">Laura</span> and the <span class="smcap">Father</span>&mdash;the <span class="smcap">Father</span> sitting at
the table by the stairs&mdash;<span class="smcap">Laura</span>, standing, watches
<span class="smcap">Craig</span> pass the door; she has in her hand a paper on
which are some memoranda. After watching <span class="smcap">Craig</span>
she sighs, looks at her notes, sits down.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Laura</span></p>

<p>I’m sorry to be troubling you, Mr. Allen. Certainly
you should not be asked to discuss these matters about&mdash;arrangements.
But really, you and I seem the only
people who are capable of going on with things. I
must say, I don’t know what to make of everyone else.
They all seem to be trying to&mdash;keep away from one.
I think that’s a little unnecessary. Of course I know
what grief does, and I’m sure I have every consideration
for that, but really&mdash;I’m sorry Craig keeps his
own sister out. When I’m here to help him. And
Abbie&mdash;why she seems to have lost her head. Just
when it’s so important that she look after things. And
as to Margaret Pierce&mdash;she certainly is worse than
useless. I don’t see what she came for if she didn’t
want to be helpful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>Margaret and Bernice were very dear friends, Laura.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Laura</span></p>

<p>Is that any reason for not being helpful in Bernice’s
household at a time like this? Really I do like control.
[<em>After looking at her notes.</em>] Then the minister will
come here at three, Mr. Allen. Why that will be little
more than an hour! Think of things having been neglected
like this! [<em>As <span class="smcap">Craig</span>, having turned in his walk,
is again passing the door.</em>] Craig! [<em>He steps to the
door.</em>] The minister, Mr. Howe, will come here,
Craig, at three.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>What for?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Laura</span></p>

<p>Craig! What <em>for</em>?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>I don’t see why he comes here. Why Bernice
scarcely knew him. [<em>To her father.</em>] Did Bernice
know him?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>Well, I don’t know whether she knew him, but&mdash;</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Laura</span></p>

<p>It is not a personal matter, Craig.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>You mean to say you are not going to have any
<em>service</em>?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>I haven’t thought anything about it. Oh, Laura!
How can I think of such things now?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Laura</span></p>

<p>Well, I will think of them for you, dear.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>Don’t bring him here. He can go&mdash;[<em>Stops</em>] there,
if he wants to. Where&mdash;we have to go. Not here.
In her own house. The very last thing.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>I’m afraid it will seem strange, Craig.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>Strange? Do I care if it seems strange? Bernice
seemed strange too. But she wasn’t strange. She
was wonderful. [<em>Putting out his hand impatiently.</em>]
Oh, <em>no</em>, Laura. There’s so much else to think of&mdash;now.</p>

<p class="sd">[<em>He steps out of the door and stands

doing&mdash;happier things? But there’s something in my
blood <em>drives</em> me to&mdash;what’s right.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>And something in <em>my</em> blood drives me to what’s

it was right at the very <em>end</em> of her life. Maybe when
we’re going to die things we’ve borne all our lives are
things we can’t bear any longer. Just&mdash;don’t count
that last hour.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

right <em>there</em>. She hadn’t left her life.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>Well, and if she hadn’t left her life! If all those
years with him there was something she hid, and if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
she seemed to feel&mdash;what she didn’t feel. She did
it well, didn’t she?&mdash;and almost to the last. Shan’t
we hide it now? For her? You and me, who loved
her&mdash;isn’t she <em>safe</em>&mdash;with us? [<em>Going nearer <span class="smcap">Margaret</span>.</em>]

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>Yes, I think you are too. I can see myself as I’d

[<em>Thinks, shakes her head.</em>] It would be left you&mdash;what

it’s hard to talk of such things. But before we&mdash;take
Bernice away, before you&mdash;see her the last

had called to me. Abbie and I were in there
and&mdash;Abbie went out, about the telephone call we
had in for the doctor. I was all alone in there a few
minutes&mdash;right at the last. Bernice said one last
word, Margaret. Your name.</p>

<p>No, I wouldn’t say she called to you. Just said
your name. The way we say things to ourselves&mdash;say
them without knowing we were going to say them.

to come from her whole life.</p>

go back to my make-believe, now that I’ve got <em>to</em>

<h2>SUPPRESSED DESIRES</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Scene I</span>: <em>A studio apartment in an upper story,
Washington Square South. Through an immense
north window in the back wall appear tree tops and
the upper part of the Washington Arch. Beyond it
you look up Fifth Avenue. Near the window is a
big table, loaded at one end with serious-looking books
and austere scientific periodicals. At the other end
are architect’s drawings, blue prints, dividing compasses,
square, ruler, etc. At the left is a door leading
to the rest of the apartment; at the right the outer
door. A breakfast table is set for three, but only
two are seated at it&mdash;<span class="smcap">Henrietta</span> and <span class="smcap">Stephen
Brewster</span>. As the curtains withdraw <span class="smcap">Steve</span> pushes
back his coffee cup and sits dejected.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>It isn’t the coffee, Steve dear. There’s nothing the
matter with the coffee. There’s something the matter
with <em>you</em>.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Steve</span></p>

<p>[<em>Doggedly.</em>] There may be something the matter
with my stomach.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>[<em>Scornfully.</em>] Your stomach! The trouble is not
with your stomach but in your subconscious mind.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Steve</span></p>

<p>Steve, you never used to be so disagreeable. You
certainly have got some sort of a complex. You’re all
inhibited. You’re no longer open to new ideas. You
won’t listen to a word about psychoanalysis.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Steve</span></p>

<p>A word! I’ve listened to volumes!</p>

<p>You’ve ceased to be creative in architecture&mdash;your

<p>How can I sleep, Henrietta, when you’re always
waking me up to find out what I’m dreaming?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>But dreams are so important, Steve. If you’d tell
yours to Dr. Russell he’d find out exactly what’s wrong
with you.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Steve</span></p>

<p>There’s nothing wrong with me.</p>

<p>You don’t even talk as well as you used to.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Steve</span></p>

<p>Talk? I can’t say a thing without you looking at
me in that dark fashion you have when you’re on
the trail of a complex.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Steve</span></p>

<p>Look-a-here, Mabel, I feel it’s my duty to put you

kill your father and marry your mother&mdash;</p>

fast&mdash;it was like having a tight skirt, you know; and
there was some sort of creature in a blue cap&mdash;you
know how mixed up dreams are&mdash;and it kept shouting
after me, “Step, Hen! Step, Hen!” until I got all
excited and just couldn’t move at all.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>[<em>Resting chin in palm and peering.</em>] You say you

<p>It’s like this, Mabel. You want something. You
think you can’t have it. You think it’s wrong. So
you try to think you don’t want it. Your mind protects
you&mdash;avoids pain&mdash;by refusing to think the
forbidden thing. But it’s there just the same. It
stays there shut up in your unconscious mind, and it

<p>Stephen, are you telling me that Dr. Russell&mdash;Dr.

was <em>sad</em>. Didn’t I speak sadly of&mdash;of the view?

<p>[<em>Rising.</em>] Stephen Brewster, have you no sense of
the seriousness of this? Dr. Russell doesn’t know
what our marriage has been. You do. You should
have laughed him down! Confined&mdash;in life with
me? Did you tell him that I <em>believe</em> in freedom?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Steve</span></p>

<p>I very emphatically told him that his results were
a great surprise to me.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>But you accepted them.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Steve</span></p>

<p>Oh, not at all. I merely couldn’t refute his arguments.
I’m not a psychologist. I came home to talk
it over with you. You being a disciple of psychoanalysis&mdash;</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>I ask you to go tonight. Some women would falter
at this, Steve, but I am not such a woman. I leave
you free. I do not repudiate psychoanalysis; I say
again that it has done great things. It has also made
mistakes, of course. But since you accept this analysis&mdash;[<em>She

<p>That is interesting.</p>

<p>Do calm yourself, Mabel. Surely there’s no occasion
for all this agitation.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>But there is! And when you think of the lives

<p>What did Dr. Russell say?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>Well, you see&mdash;oh, it’s the strangest thing! But
you know the voice in my dream that called “Step,
Hen!” Dr. Russell found out today that when I was
a little girl I had a story-book in words of one syllable
and I read the name Stephen wrong. I used to read
it S-t-e-p, step, h-e-n, hen. [<em>Dramatically.</em>] Step Hen
is Stephen. [<em>Enter <span class="smcap">Stephen</span>, his head bent over a
time-table.</em>] Stephen is Step Hen!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>[<em>Exploding.</em>] Well, what if Stephen is Step Hen?
[<em>Scornfully.</em>] Step Hen! Step Hen! For that ridiculous

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>Coincidence! But it’s childish to look at the mere
elements of a dream. You have to look <em>into</em> it&mdash;you
have to see what it <em>means</em>!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>On account of that trivial, meaningless play on
syllables&mdash;on that flimsy basis&mdash;you are ready&mdash;[<em>Wails.</em>]
O-h!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Steve</span></p>

<p>What on earth’s the matter? What has happened?
Suppose I <em>am</em> Step Hen? What about it? What
does it mean?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>[<em>Crying.</em>] It means&mdash;that I&mdash;have a suppressed
desire for <em>you</em>!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Steve</span></p>

<p>For me! The deuce you have! [<em>Feebly.</em>] What&mdash;er&mdash;makes
you think so?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>Dr. Russell has worked it out scientifically.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>Yes. Through the amazing discovery that Step Hen
equals Stephen!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>[<em>Tearfully.</em>] Oh, that isn’t all&mdash;that isn’t near all.
Henrietta won’t give me a chance to tell it. She’d
rather I’d go to the insane asylum than be unconventional.</p>

<p>[<em>Drying her eyes.</em>] Oh, there’s such a lot about
names. [<em>With some pride.</em>] I don’t see how I ever
did it. It all works in together. I dreamed I was
a hen because that’s the first syllable of <em>Hen</em>-rietta’s
name, and when I dreamed I was a hen, I was putting
myself in Henrietta’s place.</p>

<p>Why&mdash;I thought&mdash;you were so keen to have me

Canada, and join Billy&mdash;a little shooting&mdash;but&mdash;</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>But there’s more about the names.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>Mabel, have you thought of Bob&mdash;dear old Bob&mdash;your
good, kind husband?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>Oh, Henrietta, “my good, kind husband!”</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>Think of him, Mabel, out there alone in Chicago,
working his head off, fixing people’s <em>teeth</em>&mdash;for you!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>Yes, but think of the living Libido&mdash;in conflict
with petrified moral codes! And think of the perfectly
wonderful way the names all prove it. Dr. Russell
said he’s never seen anything more convincing. Just
look at Stephen’s last name&mdash;Brewster. I dream
I’m a hen, and the name Brewster&mdash;you have to say
its first letter by itself&mdash;and then the hen, that’s me,
she says to him: “Stephen, Be Rooster!”</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Steve</span></p>

<p>Well, what’s to be done about it? Does Mabel

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>[<em>Going to her.</em>] Mabel, are you going to insist

<p>I’d rather go with Stephen than go to the insane
asylum!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>For heaven’s sake, Mabel, drop that insane asylum!
If you <em>did</em> have a suppressed desire for Stephen hidden
away in you&mdash;God knows it isn’t hidden now. Dr.
Russell has brought it into your consciousness&mdash;with
a vengeance. That’s all that’s necessary to break up
a complex. Psychoanalysis doesn’t say you have to
<em>gratify</em> every suppressed desire.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Steve</span></p>

<p>According to Henrietta, you, the hen, have a suppressed
desire for <em>Egg</em>leston, the egg.</p>

<p>Henrietta, I think that’s indecent of you! He is
bald as an egg and little and fat&mdash;the idea of you

<p>Well, Bob isn’t little and bald and fat! Why don’t
you stick to your own husband? [<em>To <span class="smcap">Stephen</span>.</em>]
What if Dr. Russell’s interpretation has got mine “beat
a mile”? [<em>Resentful look at him.</em>] It would only
mean that Mabel doesn’t want Eggleston and does want
you. Does that mean she has to have you?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>But you said Mabel Snow&mdash;</p>

<h2>TICKLESS TIME</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <em>A garden in Provincetown. On the spectator’s
right a two-story house runs back from the
proscenium&mdash;a door towards the front, a second-story
window towards the back. Across the back runs
a thick-set row of sunflowers nearly concealing a fence
or wall. Back of this are trees and sky. There is a
gate at the left rear corner of the garden. People
entering it come straight toward the front, down the
left side and, to reach the house
door, pass across the front of
the stage. A fence with sunflowers
like that at the back
closes off the left wing of the
stage&mdash;a tree behind this left
fence.</em></p>

<p><em>The sun-dial stands on a broad
step or pedestal which partly
masks the digging which takes
place behind it. The position of
the sun-dial is to the left of the
center of the stage midway between
front and back.</em></p>

<p><em>From behind the tree on the
left the late afternoon sun throws
a well-defined beam of light
upon the horizontal plate of the
sun-dial and upon the shaft
which supports it. On this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"><span class="normalfont">[276]</span></a></span>
shaft is the accompanying diagram: two feet high and
clearly visible.</em></p>

<p>[<em>Turning toward house and calling excitedly.</em>]
Eloise! Oh, Eloise!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Eloise</span></p>

<p>[<em>Inside house.</em>] Hello!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Ian</span></p>

<p>Come quick! You’ll miss it.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Eloise</span></p>

<p>[<em>Poking her head out of the second-story window;
she cranes her neck to look straight up in the air.</em>]
What is it?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Ian</span></p>

<p>Come down here quick or you’ll miss it.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Eloise</span></p>

<p>[<em>Disappears from window. A moment later comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"><span class="normalfont">[277]</span></a></span>
running out, one braid of hair up and one braid down.
Again looks wildly up in the air.</em>] Where is it?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Ian</span></p>

<p>[<em>Absorbed in the sun-dial.</em>] Where’s what?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Eloise</span></p>

<p>The airplane.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Ian</span></p>

<p>Airplane? It’s the sun-dial. It’s right. Just look
at this six o’clock shadow. [<em>She goes around to the
other side of it.</em>] It’s absolutely, mathematically&mdash;you’re
in the way of the sun, Eloise. [<em>She steps
aside.</em>] Look! the style is set square on the true north&mdash;this
is the fifteenth of June&mdash;the clock is checked
to the second by telegraph with the observatory at
Washington and see! the clock is exactly nineteen
minutes and twenty seconds behind the shadow&mdash;the
precise difference between Provincetown local time and
standard Eastern time.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Eloise</span></p>

<p>Then the sun-dial’s really finished&mdash;and working
right! After all these, weeks! Oh, Ian!</p>

<p class="sd">[<em>Embraces him.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Ian</span></p>

<p>It’s good to get it right after all those mistakes.
[<em>With vision.</em>] Why, Eloise, getting this right has
been a symbol of man’s whole search for truth&mdash;the
discovery and correction of error&mdash;the mind compelled
to conform step by step to astronomical fact&mdash;to
truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Eloise</span></p>

<p>[<em>Going to it again.</em>] And to think that it’s the sun-dial
which is true and the clock&mdash;all the clocks&mdash;are
wrong! I’m glad it is true. Alice Knight has
been here talking to me for an hour. I want to think
that something’s true.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Ian</span></p>

<p>That’s just it, Eloise. The sun-dial is more than
sun-dial. It’s a first-hand relation with truth. A personal
relation. When you take your time from a clock
you are mechanically getting information from a machine.
You’re nothing but a clock yourself.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Eloise</span></p>

<p>Like Alice Knight.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Ian</span></p>

<p>But the sun-dial&mdash;this shadow is an original document&mdash;a
scholar’s source.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Eloise</span></p>

<p>To tell time by the shadow of the sun&mdash;so large
and simple.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Ian</span></p>

<p>I wouldn’t call it simple. Here on this diagram
I have worked out&mdash;</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Eloise</span></p>

<p>Dearest, you know I can’t understand diagrams.
But I get the feeling of it, Ian&mdash;the sun, the North
star. I love to think that this [<em>Placing her hands on
the style</em>] is set by the North star. [<em>Her right hand
remains on the style, her left prolongs its line heavenward.</em>]<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
Why, if I could go on long enough I’d get <em>to</em>
the North star!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Ian</span></p>

<p>[<em>Impressively.</em>] The line that passes along the edge
of this style joins the two poles of the heavens.
[<em><span class="smcap">Eloise</span> pulls away her hand as one who fears an
electric shock.</em>] Look at this slow shadow and what
you see is the spin of the earth on its axis. It is not
so much the measure of time as time itself made visible.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Eloise</span></p>

<p>[<em>Knitting her brows to get this: escaping to an impetuous
generality.</em>] Ian, which do you think is the
more wonderful&mdash;space <em>or</em> time?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Ian</span></p>

<p>[<em>Again sighting over his east and west lines. Good-humoredly.</em>]
Both are a little large for our approbation.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Eloise</span></p>

<p>[<em>Sitting on the steps and putting up the other braid.</em>]
Do you know, Ian, that’s the one thing about them
I don’t quite like. You can’t get very intimate with
them, can you? They make you so humble. That’s
one nice thing about a clock. A clock is sometimes
wrong.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Ian</span></p>

<p>Don’t you want to live in a first-hand relation to
truth?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Eloise</span></p>

<p>Yes; yes, I do&mdash;generally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Ian</span></p>

<p>I have a feeling as of having touched vast forces.
To work directly with worlds&mdash;it lifts me out of that
little routine of our lives which is itself a clock.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Eloise</span></p>

<p>[<em>Catching his exultation.</em>] Let us <em>be</em> like this! Let
us have done with clocks!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Ian</span></p>

<p>Eloise, how wonderful! Can the clocks and live by
the sun-dial? Live by the non-automatic sun-dial&mdash;as
a pledge that we ourselves refuse to be automatons!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Eloise</span></p>

<p>Like Alice Knight. [<em>She takes clock from dial and
puts it face downward on the ground.</em>] I shall never
again have anything to do with a clock!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Ian</span></p>

<p>Eloise! How corking of you! I didn’t think you
had it in you. [<em>Raising his right hand.</em>] Do you
solemnly swear to live by the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Eloise</span></p>

<p>[<em>Her hand upon the sun-dial.</em>] I swear.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Ian</span></p>

<p>Bring them!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Eloise</span></p>

<p>Bring&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Ian</span></p>

<p>The clocks! Bring them! [<em>Seizes the spade over
by the house; begins to dig a grave behind the sun-dial.</em>]
Bring every one! We will bury the clocks
before the sun-dial&mdash;an offering, a living sacrifice.
I tell you this is <em>great</em>, Eloise. What is a clock?
Something agreed upon and arbitrarily imposed upon
us. Standard time. Not true time. Symbolizing the
whole standardization of our lives. Clocks! Why,
it is clockiness that makes America mechanical and
mean! Clock-minded! A clock is a little machine
that shuts us out from the wonder of time. [<em>A large
gesture with the shovel.</em>] Who thinks of spinning
worlds when looking at a clock? How <em>dare</em> clocks do
this to us? But the sun-dial&mdash;because there was creation,
because there are worlds outside our world, because
space is rhythm and time is flow that shadow
falls precisely there and not elsewhere! Bring them,
Eloise! I am digging the graves of the clocks!</p>

<p class="sd">[<em><span class="smcap">Eloise</span> swept up by this ecstasy, yet

down at him from window, in her

<p>It’s a nice thing to hear. The ticking of a clock
means the minds of many men. As long as the mind
of man has to&mdash;fix up the facts of nature in order
to create ideal time I feel it’s a little more substantial
to have the minds of many men.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p>As I’ve told you before, Eloise, you can’t do better
than accept the things that have been all worked out
for you.</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
