<h2>TRIFLES</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <em>The kitchen in the now abandoned farmhouse
of <span class="smcap">John Wright</span>, a gloomy kitchen, and left
without having been put in order&mdash;unwashed pans
under the sink, a loaf of bread outside the bread-box,
a dish-towel on the table&mdash;other signs of incompleted
work. At the rear the outer door opens and the
<span class="smcap">Sheriff</span> comes in followed by the <span class="smcap">County Attorney</span>
and <span class="smcap">Hale</span>. The <span class="smcap">Sheriff</span> and <span class="smcap">Hale</span> are men in middle
life, the <span class="smcap">County Attorney</span> is a young man; all are
much bundled up and go at once to the stove. They
are followed by the two women&mdash;the <span class="smcap">Sheriff’s</span> wife
first; she is a slight wiry woman, a thin nervous face.
<span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale</span> is larger and would ordinarily be called
more comfortable looking, but she is disturbed now
and looks fearfully about as she enters. The women
have come in slowly, and stand close together near the
door.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span></p>

<p>[<em>Rubbing his hands.</em>] This feels good. Come up
to the fire, ladies.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters</span></p>

<p>[<em>After taking a step forward.</em>] I’m not&mdash;cold.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Sheriff</span></p>

<p>[<em>Unbuttoning his overcoat and stepping away from
the stove as if to mark the beginning of official business.</em>]
Now, Mr. Hale, before we move things about,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
you explain to Mr. Henderson just what you saw
when you came here yesterday morning.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span></p>

<p>By the way, has anything been moved? Are things
just as you left them yesterday?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Sheriff</span></p>

<p>[<em>Looking about.</em>] It’s just the same. When it
dropped below zero last night I thought I’d better
send Frank out this morning to make a fire for us&mdash;no
use getting pneumonia with a big case on, but I
told him not to touch anything except the stove&mdash;and
you know Frank.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span></p>

<p>Somebody should have been left here yesterday.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Sheriff</span></p>

<p>Oh&mdash;yesterday. When I had to send Frank to
Morris Center for that man who went crazy&mdash;I want
you to know I had my hands full yesterday. I knew
you could get back from Omaha by today and as
long as I went over everything here myself&mdash;</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span></p>

<p>Well, Mr. Hale, tell just what happened when you
came here yesterday morning.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Hale</span></p>

<p>Harry and I had started to town with a load of
potatoes. We came along the road from my place
and as I got here I said, “I’m going to see if I can’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
get John Wright to go in with me on a party telephone.”
I spoke to Wright about it once before and he put
me off, saying folks talked too much anyway, and all
he asked was peace and quiet&mdash;I guess you know
about how much he talked himself; but I thought
maybe if I went to the house and talked about it before
his wife, though I said to Harry that I didn’t know
as what his wife wanted made much difference to
John&mdash;</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span></p>

<p>Let’s talk about that later, Mr. Hale. I do want
to talk about that, but tell now just what happened
when you got to the house.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Hale</span></p>

<p>I didn’t hear or see anything; I knocked at the
door, and still it was all quiet inside. I knew they
must be up, it was past eight o’clock. So I knocked
again, and I thought I heard somebody say, “Come in.”
I wasn’t sure, I’m not sure yet, but I opened the door&mdash;this
door [<em>indicating the door by which the two
women are still standing</em>] and there in that rocker&mdash;[<em>pointing
to it</em>] sat Mrs. Wright.</p>

<p class="sd">[<em>They all look at the rocker.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span></p>

<p>What&mdash;was she doing?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Hale</span></p>

<p>She was rockin’ back and forth. She had her apron
in her hand and was kind of&mdash;pleating it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span></p>

<p>And how did she&mdash;look?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Hale</span></p>

<p>Well, she looked queer.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span></p>

<p>How do you mean&mdash;queer?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Hale</span></p>

<p>Well, as if she didn’t know what she was going
to do next. And kind of done up.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span></p>

<p>How did she seem to feel about your coming?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Hale</span></p>

<p>Why, I don’t think she minded&mdash;one way or other.
She didn’t pay much attention. I said, “How do,
Mrs. Wright, it’s cold, ain’t it?” And she said, “Is
it?”&mdash;and went on kind of pleating at her apron.
Well, I was surprised; she didn’t ask me to come up
to the stove, or to set down, but just sat there, not even
looking at me, so I said, “I want to see John.” And
then she&mdash;laughed. I guess you would call it a laugh.
I thought of Harry and the team outside, so I said
a little sharp: “Can’t I see John?” “No,” she
says, kind o’ dull like. “Ain’t he home?” says I.
“Yes,” says she, “he’s home.” “Then why can’t I
see him?” I asked her, out of patience. “’Cause
he’s dead,” says she. “<em>Dead?</em>” says I. She just
nodded her head, not getting a bit excited, but rockin’
back and forth. “Why&mdash;where is he?” says I, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
knowing what to say. She just pointed upstairs&mdash;like
that [<em>himself pointing to the room above</em>]. I
got up, with the idea of going up there. I walked
from there to here&mdash;then I says, “Why, what did
he die of?” “He died of a rope round his neck,”
says she, and just went on pleatin’ at her apron. Well,
I went out and called Harry. I thought I might&mdash;need
help. We went upstairs and there he was lyin’&mdash;</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span></p>

<p>I think I’d rather have you go into that upstairs,
where you can point it all out. Just go on now with
the rest of the story.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Hale</span></p>

<p>Well, my first thought was to get that rope off. It
looked ... [<em>Stops, his face twitches</em>] ... but Harry,
he went up to him, and he said, “No, he’s dead all
right, and we’d better not touch anything.” So we
went back down stairs. She was still sitting that same
way. “Has anybody been notified?” I asked. “No,”
says she, unconcerned. “Who did this, Mrs.
Wright?” said Harry. He said it business-like&mdash;and
she stopped pleatin’ of her apron. “I don’t
know,” she says. “You don’t <em>know</em>?” says Harry.
“No,” says she. “Weren’t you sleepin’ in the bed
with him?” says Harry. “Yes,” says she, “but I
was on the inside.” “Somebody slipped a rope round
his neck and strangled him and you didn’t wake up?”
says Harry. “I didn’t wake up,” she said after him.
We must ’a looked as if we didn’t see how that could
be, for after a minute she said, “I sleep sound.”
Harry was going to ask her more questions but I said
maybe we ought to let her tell her story first to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
coroner, or the sheriff, so Harry went fast as he could
to Rivers’ place, where there’s a telephone.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span></p>

<p>And what did Mrs. Wright do when she knew that
you had gone for the coroner?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Hale</span></p>

<p>She moved from that chair to this one over here
[<em>Pointing to a small chair in the corner</em>] and just sat
there with her hands held together and looking down.
I got a feeling that I ought to make some conversation,
so I said I had come in to see if John wanted to put
in a telephone, and at that she started to laugh, and
then she stopped and looked at me&mdash;scared. [<em>The
<span class="smcap">County Attorney</span>, who has had his notebook out,
makes a note.</em>] I dunno, maybe it wasn’t scared. I
wouldn’t like to say it was. Soon Harry got back, and
then Dr. Lloyd came, and you, Mr. Peters, and so I
guess that’s all I know that you don’t.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span></p>

<p>[<em>Looking around.</em>] I guess we’ll go upstairs first&mdash;and
then out to the barn and around there. [<em>To
the <span class="smcap">Sheriff</span>.</em>] You’re convinced that there was nothing
important here&mdash;nothing that would point to any
motive.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Sheriff</span></p>

<p>Nothing here but kitchen things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p class="sd">[<em>The <span class="smcap">County Attorney</span>, after again
looking around the kitchen, opens
the door of a cupboard closet. He
gets up on a chair and looks on a
shelf. Pulls his hand away, sticky.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span></p>

<p>Here’s a nice mess.</p>

<p class="sd">[<em>The women draw nearer.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters</span></p>

<p>[<em>To the other woman.</em>] Oh, her fruit; it did freeze.
[<em>To the <span class="smcap">Lawyer</span>.</em>] She worried about that when it
turned so cold. She said the fire’d go out and her
jars would break.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Sheriff</span></p>

<p>Well, can you beat the women! Held for murder
and worryin’ about her preserves.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span></p>

<p>I guess before we’re through she may have something
more serious than preserves to worry about.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Hale</span></p>

<p>Well, women are used to worrying over trifles.</p>

<p class="sd">[<em>The two women move a little closer
together.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span></p>

<p>[<em>With the gallantry of a young politician.</em>] And
yet, for all their worries, what would we do without
the ladies? [<em>The women do not unbend. He goes
to the sink, takes a dipperful of water from the pail
and pouring it into a basin, washes his hands. Starts
to wipe them on the roller-towel, turns it for a cleaner
place.</em>] Dirty towels! [<em>Kicks his foot against the
pans under the sink.</em>] Not much of a housekeeper,
would you say, ladies?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale</span></p>

<p>[<em>Stiffly.</em>] There’s a great deal of work to be done
on a farm.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span></p>

<p>To be sure. And yet [<em>With a little bow to her</em>] I
know there are some Dickson county farmhouses which
do not have such roller towels.</p>

<p class="sd">[<em>He gives it a pull to expose its full
length again.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale</span></p>

<p>Those towels get dirty awful quick. Men’s hands
aren’t always as clean as they might be.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span></p>

<p>Ah, loyal to your sex, I see. But you and Mrs.
Wright were neighbors. I suppose you were friends,
too.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale</span></p>

<p>[<em>Shaking her head.</em>] I’ve not seen much of her of
late years. I’ve not been in this house&mdash;it’s more
than a year.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span></p>

<p>And why was that? You didn’t like her?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale</span></p>

<p>I liked her all well enough. Farmers’ wives have
their hands full, Mr. Henderson. And then&mdash;</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span></p>

<p>Yes&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale</span></p>

<p>[<em>Looking about.</em>] It never seemed a very cheerful
place.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span></p>

<p>No&mdash;it’s not cheerful. I shouldn’t say she had the
homemaking instinct.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale</span></p>

<p>Well, I don’t know as Wright had, either.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span></p>

<p>You mean that they didn’t get on very well?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale</span></p>

<p>No, I don’t mean anything. But I don’t think a
place’d be any cheerfuller for John Wright’s being
in it.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span></p>

<p>I’d like to talk more of that a little later. I want
to get the lay of things upstairs now.</p>

<p class="sd">[<em>He goes to the left, where three steps
lead to a stair door.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Sheriff</span></p>

<p>I suppose anything Mrs. Peters does’ll be all right.
She was to take in some clothes for her, you know,
and a few little things. We left in such a hurry
yesterday.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span></p>

<p>Yes, but I would like to see what you take, Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Peters, and keep an eye out for anything that might
be of use to us.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters</span></p>

<p>Yes, Mr. Henderson.</p>

<p class="sd">[<em>The women listen to the men’s steps
on the stairs, then look about the
kitchen.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale</span></p>

<p>I’d hate to have men coming into my kitchen, snooping
around and criticising.</p>

<p class="sd">[<em>She arranges the pans under sink which
the <span class="smcap">Lawyer</span> had shoved out of place.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters</span></p>

<p>Of course it’s no more than their duty.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale</span></p>

<p>Duty’s all right, but I guess that deputy sheriff that
came out to make the fire might have got a little of
this on. [<em>Gives the roller towel a pull.</em>] Wish I’d
thought of that sooner. Seems mean to talk about
her for not having things slicked up when she had
to come away in such a hurry.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters</span></p>

<p>[<em>Who has gone to a small table in the left rear
corner of the room, and lifted one end of a towel
that covers a pan.</em>] She had bread set.</p>

<p class="sd">[<em>Stands still.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale</span></p>

<h2>THE PEOPLE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <em>The office of “The People,” a morning in
March, 1917. There is little furniture&mdash;a long table
strewn with manuscripts and papers, a desk. On the
walls are revolutionary posters; wads of paper are
thrown about on the floor&mdash;the office of a publication
which is radical and poor. This is an inner office;
at the rear is the door into the outer one. <span class="smcap">Oscar</span> is
seated at the table writing. <span class="smcap">Tom</span>, a printer who loves
the cause&mdash;or the crowd&mdash;almost enough to print
for it, comes from the other room, a galley-proof in
his hand.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Tom</span></p>

<p>Why are you writing?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Oscar</span></p>

<p>[<em>Jauntily.</em>] Because I am a writer.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Tom</span></p>

<p>But I thought you said there wasn’t going to be
another issue of <cite>The People</cite>.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Oscar</span></p>

<p>[<em>With dignity.</em>] I am writing.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Tom</span></p>

<p>There’s a woman here with a suit case.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Oscar</span></p>

<p>What’s in it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>She wants to see the Editor.</p>

<p>[<em>After writing.</em>] All right.</p>

<p class="sd">[<em><span class="smcap">Tom</span> goes out and a moment later the
woman appears. She is middle
aged, wears plain clothes not in fashion.
Her manner is a little shrinking
and yet as she stands in the
doorway looking about the bare
room, her face is the face of one who
has come a long way and reached a
wonderful place.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">The Woman</span></p>

<p>This <i>is</i> the office of <cite>The People</cite>?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">The Woman</span></p>

<p>About moving toward the beautiful distances.</p>

couldn’t I?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Oscar</span></p>

<p>Yes, if its important. Of course he’ll be very busy.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">The Woman</span></p>

<p>It is important. At least&mdash;yes, it is important.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Oscar</span></p>

<p>Very well then&mdash;later in the morning.</p>

<p>[<em>Thinking aloud.</em>] I will stand down on the street
and watch the people go by.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Oscar</span></p>

<p>What?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">The Woman</span></p>

<p>The people. It’s so wonderful to see them&mdash;so
many of them. Don’t you often just stand and watch
them?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Oscar</span></p>

<p>No, madam, not often. I am too busy editing a
magazine about them.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">The Woman</span></p>

<p>Of course you are busy. You help edit this magazine?</p>

<p class="sd">[<em>Looks about at the posters.</em></p>

<p>That’s a great thing for you&mdash;and you so young.
Does Mr. Wills write in this room?</p>

<p>[<em>Putting it down near the door.</em>] Oh, thank you.
I see you are a kind young man.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Oscar</span></p>

<p>That is not the general opinion.</p>

often wrong?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Oscar</span></p>

<p>I don’t see how it can, but many a time I haven’t
seen how it could&mdash;and it did. Doubtless it will go
on, and will see days so much worse than these that
we will say, “Ah, the good old days of March, 1917.”</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Tom</span></p>

<p>But can it pay salaries?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Oscar</span></p>

<p>[<em>Shocked.</em>] Oh, no, I think not; but we must work

up to you, Ed.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Ed</span></p>

<p>Just what would we be going on for? To make
a few more people like the dear ones who have just
left us? Seems to me we could best serve society by
not doing that. Precisely what do we do?&mdash;aside
from getting under the bed in Bronxville. Now and
then something particularly rotten is put over and we
have a story that gets a rise out of a few people, but&mdash;we
don’t change anything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Sara</span></p>

<p>We had another hope. We were going to express
ourselves so simply and so truly that we would be
expressing the people.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Ed</span></p>

<p>[<em>Wearily.</em>] The People. I looked at them all the
way across this continent. Oh, I got so tired looking
at them&mdash;on farms, in towns, in cities. They’re like
toys that you wind up and they’ll run awhile. They
don’t want to be expressed. It would topple them
over. The longer I looked the more ridiculous it
seemed to me that we should be giving our lives to&mdash;[<em>Picks
up the magazine and reads.</em>] <cite>The People</cite>&mdash;“A
Journal of the Social Revolution.” Certainly we’d
better cut the sub-title. The social revolution is dead.</p>

<p>You don’t think you are bringing back any news,
do you, Ed?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Artist</span></p>

could have a design. Much better.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Ed</span></p>

<p>You can’t keep vision in this office. It’s easy enough
to have a beautiful feeling about the human race<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
when none of it is around. The trouble about doing
anything for your fellow-man is that you have to do
it with a few of them. Oh, of course that isn’t fair.
We care. I’ll say that for us. Even Oscar cares,
or he wouldn’t work the way he has. But what does
our caring come to? It doesn’t connect up with anything,
and God knows it doesn’t seem to be making
anything very beautiful of us. There’s something
rather pathetic about us.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Oscar</span></p>

<p>Or is it merely ridiculous?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Sara</span></p>

<p>Let me read you something, Ed. [<em>She takes The
People and reads very simply.</em>] “We are living now.
We shall not be living long. No one can tell us we
shall live again. This is our little while. This is
our chance. And we take it like a child who comes
from a dark room to which he must return&mdash;comes
for one sunny afternoon to a lovely hillside, and finding
a hole, crawls in there till after the sun is set. I
want that child to know the sun is shining upon flowers
in the grass. I want him to know it before he has
to go back to the room that is dark. I wish I had
pipes to call him to the hilltop of beautiful distances.
I myself could see farther if he were seeing at all.
Perhaps I can tell <em>you</em>: you who have dreamed and
dreaming know, and knowing care. Move! Move
from the things that hold you. If you move, others
will move. Come! Now. Before the sun goes
down.” [<em>Very quietly.</em>] You wrote that, Ed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Ed</span></p>

<p>Yes, I wrote it; and do you want to know why I
wrote it? I wrote it because I was sore at Oscar

ashamed of himself.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">The Boy</span></p>

<p>[<em>Blithely.</em>] I’ve come too. I’m from Georgia. I
read it, and I didn’t want to stay at school any longer.
I said, “I want something different and bigger&mdash;something
more like this.” I heard about your not
being able to sell your paper on the newsstands just
because lots of people don’t want anything different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
and bigger, and I said to myself, “I’ll sell the paper!
I’ll go and sell it on the streets!” And I got so
excited about it that I didn’t even wait for the dance.

had a chance to go in on an oyster bed. I read what

left it, and I said to myself, “I’m nothing but an

<p>Oscar, try and act as if you had a soul.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">The Woman</span></p>

<p>I think he really has. [<em>A look at <span class="smcap">Oscar</span>&mdash;then,

feels he must be witty. But you&mdash;you’re not going
to let us just go away again, are you? He gave up
his oyster bed, and this boy didn’t even wait for the
dance, and me&mdash;I gave up my tombstone.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Ed</span></p>

<p>Your&mdash;?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">The Woman</span></p>

<p>Yes&mdash;tombstone. It had always been a saying in
our family&mdash;“He won’t even have a stone to mark
his grave.” They said it so much that I thought it
meant something. I sew&mdash;plain sewing, but I’ve
often said to myself&mdash;“Well, at least I’ll have a stone
to mark my grave.” And then, there was a man who
had been making speeches to the miners&mdash;I live in a
town in Idaho&mdash;and he had your magazine, and he
left it in the store, and the storekeeper said to me,
when I went there for thread&mdash;“Here, you like to
read. Don’t you want this? I wish you’d take it
away, because if some folks in this town see it, they’ll
think I’m not all I should be.” He meant the cover.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Artist</span></p>

<p>[<em>Brightening.</em>] That was my cover.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">The Woman</span></p>

<p>[<em>After a smile at <span class="smcap">The Artist</span>.</em>] So I took it home,
and when my work was done that night, I read your
wonderful words. They’re like a spring&mdash;if you’ve
lived in a dry country, you’ll know what I mean. And
they made me know that my tombstone was as dead
as&mdash;well, [<em>With a little laugh</em>] as dead as a tombstone.
So I had to have something to take its place.</p>

the law, if you have the right idea?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">The Woman</span></p>

<p>No&mdash;I’ll go. [<em>Stands there uncertainly.</em>] I don’t
know why I should be disappointed. I suppose it’s
not fair to ask you to be as big as the truth you saw.
Why should I expect you would be?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Ed</span></p>

<p>I’m sorry. I suppose now you’ll regret your tombstone.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">The Woman</span></p>

<p>No&mdash;it was wonderful to ride across this country
and see all the people. The train moving along seemed
to make something move in me. I had thoughts not
like any thoughts I’d ever had before&mdash;your words
like a spring breaking through the dry country of
my mind. I thought of how you call your paper “A
Journal of The Social Revolution,” and I said to myself&mdash;This
is the Social Revolution! Knowing that
your tombstone doesn’t matter! <em>Seeing</em>&mdash;that’s the
Social Revolution.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Ed</span></p>

<p>Seeing&mdash;?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">The Woman</span></p>

<p>[<em>As if it is passing before her.</em>] A plain, dark
trees off at the edge, against the trees a little house
and a big barn. A flat piece of land fenced in. Stubble,
furrows. Horses waiting to get in at the barn;
cows standing around a pump. A tile yard, a water
tank, one straight street of a little town. The country
so still it seems dead. The trees like&mdash;hopes that
have been given up. The grave yards&mdash;on hills&mdash;they
come so fast. I noticed them first because of
my tombstone, but I got to thinking about the people&mdash;the
people who spent their whole lives right near
the places where they are now. There’s something
in the thought of them&mdash;like the cows standing around
the pump. So still, so patient, it&mdash;kind of hurts.
And their pleasures:&mdash;a flat field fenced in. Your
great words carried me to other great words. I
thought of Lincoln, and what he said of a few of the
dead. I said it over and over. I said things and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
didn’t know the meaning of them ’till after I had said
them. I said&mdash;“The truth&mdash;the truth&mdash;the truth
that opens from our lives as water opens from the
rocks.” Then I knew what that truth was. [<em>Pause,
with an intensity peculiarly simple.</em>] “Let us here
highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in
vain.” I mean&mdash;all of them. [<em>A gesture, wide, loving.</em>]
Let life become what it may become!&mdash;so beautiful
that everything that is back of us is worth everything
it cost.</p>

<h2>CLOSE THE BOOK</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <em>The library in the <span class="smcap">Root</span> home, the library
of middle-western people who are an important family
in their community, a university town, and who think
of themselves as people of culture. It is a room which
shows pride of family: on the rear wall are two large
family portraits&mdash;one a Revolutionary soldier, the
other a man of a later period. On the low book-cases,
to both sides of door rear, and on the mantel, right,
are miniatures and other old pictures. There is old
furniture&mdash;mahogany recently done over: an easy
chair near the fireplace, a divan left. A Winged Victory
presides over one of the book-cases, a Burne
Jones is hung. It is a warmly lighted, cheerful room&mdash;books
and flowers about. At the rear is a door
opening on the hall, at the left a door into another
room. There is a corner window at the right.
<span class="smcap">Jhansi</span> and <span class="smcap">Peyton</span> are seated on the divan. <span class="smcap">Mrs.
Root</span> is just going into the hall. She seems perturbed.
<span class="smcap">Jhansi</span> is dressed as a non-conformist, but attractively.
<span class="smcap">Peyton</span> is a rather helpless young man, with a sense
of humor that is itself rather helpless.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Root</span></p>

<p>I’ll see, Peyton, if your grandmother isn’t ready
to come down.</p>

<p class="sd">[<em>She leaves them.</em></p>

<p>I know, Jhansi, but just this once&mdash;as long as it
means so much to mother, and doesn’t really hurt us.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Jhansi</span></p>

<p>But it does hurt me, Peyton. These walls stifle
me. You come of people who have been walled in all
their lives. It doesn’t cage you. But me&mdash;I am a
gypsy! Sometimes I feel them right behind me&mdash;all
those wanderers, people who were never caught; feel
them behind me pushing me away from all this!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Peyton</span></p>

<p>But not pushing you away from me, dear. You
love me, Jhansi, in spite of my family?</p>

<p>If I didn’t love you do you think I could endure
to come to this dreadful place? [<em>A look about the

Forgive me for alluding to your home and family,
Peyton, but I must not lose my honesty, you know.</p>

<p>No, dear; I don’t think you are losing it. And
perhaps I’d better not lose mine either. There’s one
thing I haven’t mentioned yet. [<em>Hesitates.</em>] Mr.
Peyton is coming to dinner tonight.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Jhansi</span></p>

<p>Mr. Peyton. <em>What</em> Peyton?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Peyton</span></p>

<p>Yes&mdash;that one.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Jhansi</span></p>

<p>And you ask me&mdash;standing for the things I do
in this university&mdash;to sit down to dinner with the
president of the board of regents!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Peyton</span></p>

<p>Mother’d asked him before I knew it.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Jhansi</span></p>

<p>[<em>With scorn.</em>] Your uncle!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Peyton</span></p>

<p>He’s not my uncle&mdash;he’s mother’s. And you see
it’s partly on account of grandmother just getting
back from California. He’s grandmother’s brother-in-law,
you know. I suppose she doesn’t realize what
it means to have to sit down to dinner with him&mdash;she’s
done it so much. And then mother thought
it would be nice for you to meet him.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Jhansi</span></p>

<p>Nice!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Peyton</span></p>

<p>He’s pleasant at dinner.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Jhansi</span></p>

<p>Pleasant!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Peyton</span></p>

<p>Mother’s a little worried about my position in the
university.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Jhansi</span></p>

<p>It would be wonderful for you to lose your position
in the university.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Peyton</span></p>

<p>Yes&mdash;wonderful.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Jhansi</span></p>

<p>And then you and I could walk forth free!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Peyton</span></p>

<p>Free&mdash;but broke.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Jhansi</span></p>

<p>Peyton, you disappoint me. Just the fact that that
man is coming to dinner changes you.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Peyton</span></p>

<p>Oh, no. But you are fortunately situated, Jhansi,
having no people. It’s easier to be free when there’s
nobody who minds.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Jhansi</span></p>

<p>I am going!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Peyton</span></p>

<p>Oh come now, dearest, you can’t go when you’re
expected for dinner. Nobody’s that free.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Jhansi</span></p>

<p>Dinner! A dinner to celebrate our engagement!
It’s humiliating, Peyton. I should take you by the
hand and you and I should walk together down the
open road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Peyton</span></p>

<p>We will, Jhansi; we will&mdash;in time.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Jhansi</span></p>

<p>We should go now.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Peyton</span></p>

<p>Think so? Mother’s going to have turkey.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Jhansi</span></p>

<p>Better a dinner of berries and nuts&mdash;!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Peyton</span></p>

<p>We’ll have berries&mdash;cranberries, and nuts, too.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Jhansi</span></p>

<p>Where is my coat?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Peyton</span></p>

<p>[<em>Seizing her and kissing her.</em>] Some day, serene
and unhampered, we’ll take to the open road&mdash;a road
with berries and nuts.</p>

<p class="sd">[<em><span class="smcap">Grandmother Peyton</span> and <span class="smcap">Mrs. Root</span>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Root</span></p>

<p>Mother, this is Peyton’s friend Miss Mason. One
of our important students.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span></p>

<p>[<em>In her brittle way.</em>] Yes? I never was a very
important student myself. I didn’t like to study. Because
my family were professors, I suppose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Root</span></p>

<p>Peyton’s grandmother is a descendant of Gustave
Phelps&mdash;one of the famous teachers of pioneer days.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Jhansi</span></p>

<p>[<em>Her head going up.</em>] I am a descendant of people
who never taught anybody anything!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Peyton</span></p>

<p>Jhansi and I were just going to finish an article
on Free Speech which must get to the Torch this
evening.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span></p>

<p>[<em>Moving toward the big chair near the fire.</em>] Free
Speech? How amusing.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Peyton</span></p>

<p>You may be less amused some day, grandmother.</p>

<p class="sd">[<em><span class="smcap">Jhansi</span> and <span class="smcap">Peyton</span> go into the other
room.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span></p>

<p>That may be a free speech. I wouldn’t call it a
pleasant one.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Root</span></p>

<p>[<em>Sinking to the divan.</em>] Oh, he was speaking of
the open road again&mdash;berries and nuts&mdash;!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span></p>

<p>[<em>Beginning to knit.</em>] Berries and nuts? Well, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
sounds quite innocuous to me. Some of our young
people are less simple in their tastes.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Root</span></p>

<p>[<em>In great distress.</em>] Mother, how would you like
to see your grandson become a gypsy?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span></p>

<p>Peyton a gypsy? You mean in a carnival?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Root</span></p>

<p>No, not in a carnival! In <em>life</em>.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span></p>

<p>But he isn’t dark enough.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Root</span></p>

<p>And is <em>that</em> the only thing against it! I had thought
you would be a help to me, mother.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span></p>

<p>Well, my dear Clara, I have no doubt I will be a
help to you&mdash;in time. This idea of Peyton becoming
a gypsy is too startling for me to be a help instantly.
In the first place, could he be? You can’t be anything
you take it into your head to be&mdash;even if it is undesirable.
And then, why should he be? Doesn’t he
still teach English right here in the university?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Root</span></p>

<p>I don’t know how much longer he’ll teach it. He
said the other day that American literature was a
toddy with the <em>stick</em> left out. Saying that of the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
thing he’s paid to teach! It got in the papers and
was denounced in an editorial on “Untrue Americans.”
Peyton&mdash;a descendant of John Peyton of Valley
Forge! [<em>Indicates the Revolutionary portrait</em>]&mdash;denounced
in an article on Untrue Americans! And in
one of those awful columns&mdash;those silly columns&mdash;they
said maybe the stick hadn’t been left out of his
toddy. But it isn’t that. Peyton doesn’t drink&mdash;to
speak of. It’s this girl. <em>She’s</em> the stick. And I tell
you people don’t like it, mother. It’s not what we
pay our professors <em>for</em>. Peyton used to be perfectly
satisfied with civilization. But now he talks about
society. Makes light remarks.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span></p>

<p>I should say that was going out of his way to be
disagreeable. What business has a professor of English
to say anything about society? It’s not in his
department.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Root</span></p>

<p>I told Peyton he should be more systematic.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span></p>

<p>How did this gypsy get here?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Root</span></p>

<p>She was brought up by a family named Mason.
But it seems she was a gypsy child, who got lost or
something, and those Masons took her in. I’m sure
it was very good of them, and it’s too bad they weren’t
able to make her more of a Christian. She is coming
to have a following in the university! There are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
people who seem to think that because you’re outside
society you have some superior information about it.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span></p>

<p>Well, don’t you think you’re needlessly disturbed?
In my day, a young man would be likely enough to
fall in love with a good-looking gypsy, not very likely
to marry her.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Root</span></p>

<p>Times have changed, mother. They marry them
now. [<em>Both sigh.</em>] Of course, it’s very commendable
of them.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span></p>

<p>[<em>Grimly.</em>] Oh, quite&mdash;commendable.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Root</span></p>

<p>I was brought up in university circles. I’m interested
in <em>ideas</em>. But sometimes I think there are too
<em>many</em> ideas.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span></p>

<p>An embarrassment of riches. So you have set out
to civilize the young woman?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Root</span></p>

<p>I’d rather have her sit at my table than have my
son leave some morning in a covered wagon!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span></p>

<p>I wonder how it is about gypsies. About the children.
I wonder if it’s as it is with the negroes.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Root</span></p>

<p><em>Mother!</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span></p>

<p>It would be startling, wouldn’t it?&mdash;if one of them
should turn out to be a real gypsy and take to this
open road.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Root</span></p>

<p>[<em>Covering her face.</em>] Oh!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span></p>

<p>Quite likely they’d do it by motor.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Root</span></p>

<p>[<em>Rising.</em>] Mother!&mdash;how can you say such dreadful
things&mdash;and just when I have this <em>trying</em> dinner.
Oh, I wish Bessie would come! [<em>Goes to the window.</em>]
She is a comfort to me.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span></p>

<p>Where is Bessie?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Root</span></p>

<p>She’s away in the motor. [<em>Again shudders.</em>]
Bessie feels dreadfully about her brother. She is trying
to do something. She said it would be a surprise&mdash;a
happy surprise. [<em>Someone heard in the hall.</em>]
Perhaps this is Bessie. [<em>Enter <span class="smcap">Mr. Peyton</span>.</em>] Oh,
it’s Uncle George.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Uncle George</span></p>

<p>Early I know. Came to have a little visit with
Elizabeth. [<em>Goes to <span class="smcap">Grandmother</span> and shakes
hands.</em>] How are you, young woman?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span></p>

<p>My nerves seem to be stronger than the nerves I see
around me. And how are you, George?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Uncle George</span></p>

<p>Oh, I’m <em>well</em>.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span></p>

<p>But&mdash;?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Uncle George</span></p>

<p>Responsibilities.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span></p>

<p>The bank?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Uncle George</span></p>

<p>I’d rather run ten banks than a tenth of a university.
You can control money.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Root</span></p>

<p>I’m sorry, Uncle George, that Peyton should be
adding to your worries.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Uncle George</span></p>

<p>What’s the matter with Peyton?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span></p>

<p>Wild oats.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Uncle George</span></p>

<p>Well, I wish he’d sow them in less intellectual fields.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Root</span></p>

<p>I am prepared to speak freely with you, Uncle
George. The matter with Peyton is this girl. Well,
they’re going to be married. Yes [<em>Answering his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"><span class="normalfont">[74]</span></a></span>
gesture of protest</em>] and I think it’s a good thing. She
won’t be in a position to say so much about freedom
after she is married.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Uncle George</span></p>

<p>But they say she’s a gypsy.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Root</span></p>

<p>She won’t be a gypsy after she’s Peyton’s wife.
She’ll be a married woman.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Uncle George</span></p>

<p>Yes, but in the meantime we will have swallowed
a gypsy.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span></p>

<p>And I was just wondering how it would be about
the children.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Root</span></p>

<p>Mother, please don’t be indelicate again.</p>

<p class="sd">[<em>Pause.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span></p>

<p>Well, if there’s nothing else we may speak of, let’s
talk about free speech. They’re writing a paper on it
in there.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Uncle George</span></p>

<p>I don’t know what this university is coming to! An

<p>I hope you both spoke affectionately.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Uncle George</span></p>

<p>Well, Peyton, very busy I take it. You’re adding

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Peyton</span></p>

<p>Not that I know of.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Uncle George</span></p>

<p>Your grandmother said something about a high
falutin paper on free speech.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Peyton</span></p>

<p>I suppose that’s an inherited tendency. You know
one of my ancestors signed a paper on free speech.
It had a high falutin name: “The Declaration of
Independence”!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Root</span></p>

<p>I wish Bessie would come!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Uncle George</span></p>

<p>Do you think much about your ancestors, Peyton?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Uncle George</span></p>

<p>Peyton has some rather interesting ancestors, Miss
Mason. There’s Captain John Peyton. That’s his
picture. He helped win one of the battles which made
this country possible&mdash;the country in which you are
living. And a descendant of John Peyton&mdash;Richard
Peyton [<em>Points out the picture</em>] gave the money which
founded this university&mdash;the university in which you
are now acquiring your education.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Jhansi</span></p>

<p>[<em>Approaching <span class="smcap">Senator Byrd</span>.</em>] I have heard of
Senator Ephraim Byrd of the Ways and Means Committee.
That was good work you fellows&mdash;</p>

<p class="sd">[<em>They talk of this.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Root</span></p>

<p>And to think, Jhansi, that your cousin Mrs. Byrd
is a prominent clubwoman!</p>

<p>[<em>After a look at <span class="smcap">Jhansi</span>.</em>] Her cup runneth over.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Root</span></p>

<p>Isn’t Bessie wonderful, mother? How did you find
it all out, Bessie?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Bessie</span></p>

<p>From clue to clue I worked my way to Sunny Center.
I would say to myself&mdash;Do this for Peyton;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
do this for Jhansi. And so, I heard of an old minister
who had been there years and years. I went to
him and&mdash;he had married Jhansi’s father and mother!
Dearest child, your mother taught in his Sunday-School!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Senator Byrd</span></p>

<p>Oh, yes, Aggie loved the Baptist Sunday-School!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Jhansi</span></p>

<p>It’s very strange that my mother&mdash;I am referring
to Mrs. Mason&mdash;never told me of this!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Bessie</span></p>

<p>But she never told you you were a gypsy, either,
did she? No; she just wanted you to think you were
their own child. And then I suppose you heard some
foolish tale at school.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Byrd</span></p>

<p>You see Jhansi’s mother and father&mdash;her real ones&mdash;died
of typhoid fever before she was two years old.
They got it from the cows. Well, the Harrisons were
friends of the Mason’s&mdash;they all worked together in
the church&mdash;and so they took Jhansi, and soon after
that they moved away and we lost track of them. You
know what a busy world it is&mdash;particularly for people
who have duties in their community.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Jhansi</span></p>

<h2>THE OUTSIDE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <em>A room in a house which was once a life-saving
station. Since ceasing to be that it has taken
on no other character, except that of a place which
no one cares either to preserve or change. It is
painted the life-saving gray, but has not the life-saving
freshness. This is one end of what was the big boat
room, and at the ceiling is seen a part of the frame
work from which the boat once swung. About two
thirds of the back wall is open, because of the big
sliding door, of the type of barn door, and through

them the woods. At one point the line where woods
and dunes meet stands out clearly and there are indicated
the rude things, vines, bushes, which form the

the outside shore of Cape Cod, at the point, near the

build the new station and sell this one by sealed bids.
I heard them talkin’ about it. They was sittin’ right
down there on the beach, eatin’ their supper. They
was goin’ to put in a fire-place and they was goin’ to
paint it bright colors, and have parties over here&mdash;summer

I was in Bill Joseph’s grocery store, one day last
November, when in she comes&mdash;Mrs. Patrick, from
New York. “I’ve come to take the old life-saving
station,” says she. “I’m going to sleep over there
tonight!” Huh! Bill is used to queer ways&mdash;he
deals with summer folks, but that got <em>him</em>. November&mdash;an
empty house, a buried house, you might say, off
here on the outside shore&mdash;way across the sand from
man or beast. He got it out of her, not by what she
said, but by the way she looked at what he said, that her
husband had died, and she was runnin’ off to hide herself,
I guess. A person’d feel sorry for her if she
weren’t so stand-offish, and so doggon <em>mean</em>. But
mean folks have got minds of their own. She slept
here that night. Bill had men hauling things till after
dark&mdash;bed, stove, coal. And then she wanted somebody
to work for her. “Somebody,” says she, “that
doesn’t say an unnecessary word!” Well, when Bill
come to the back of the store, I said, “Looks to me
as if Allie Mayo was the party she’s lookin’ for.”
Allie Mayo has got a prejudice against words. Or
maybe she likes ’em so well she’s savin’ of ’em. She’s
not spoke an unnecessary word for twenty years.
She’s got her reasons. Women whose men go to sea
ain’t always talkative.</p>

<h2>WOMAN’S HONOR</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <em>A room in the sheriff’s house which is used
for conferences. At the rear is a door into the hall,
at the left a door leads to an adjoining room. There
is also a door at the right, going to the corridor which
connects this house with the jail.</em></p>

<p><em><span class="smcap">Lawyer</span> and <span class="smcap">Prisoner</span> are found in heated conversation.
The prisoner, an attractive young man, is
seated, and has just turned away from the <span class="smcap">Lawyer</span>,
irritated.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Lawyer</span></p>

<p>Do you know that murder is no laughing matter?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Prisoner</span></p>

<p>Well, was I laughing?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Lawyer</span></p>

<p>[<em>Shoots it at him.</em>] Where were you on the night
of October 25? [<em><span class="smcap">Prisoner</span> sits like one who never
means to speak again.</em>] Your silence shields a
woman’s honor. Do you know what’s going to be
said of you? You’re going to be called old-fashioned!
[<em>A worried look flits over the prisoner’s face.</em>] A
man will not tell where he is because it involves a
woman’s honor! How quaint! [<em>In a different voice.</em>]
Say, do you think she’s worth it?</p>

<p class="sd">[<em><span class="smcap">Prisoner</span> rises angrily.</em></p>

<p>Yes, get red in the face, I should think you would.
Blush. Blush for shame. Shame of having loved a
woman who’d let a man face death to shield her own
honor!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Prisoner</span></p>

<p>You don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Lawyer</span></p>

<p>It’s just like a woman, the cowards. That’s what
I most despise in women. Afraid they won’t be looked
upon as the pure noble sensitive souls they spend
their lives trying to make us believe they are. Sickening!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Prisoner</span></p>

<p>There are things you don’t understand.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Lawyer</span></p>

<p>Oh, yes, I do. I suppose she’s got a husband. I
suppose he’d divorce her. Then she wouldn’t be asked
out to tea quite so often. Good Lord&mdash;die for
something real!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Prisoner</span></p>

<p>You and I have different ideals, Mr. Foster. There
are things we don’t discuss.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Lawyer</span></p>

<p>There are things we have to discuss. If you insist
upon this romantic course, then at least we will have
to get something out of <em>that</em>.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Prisoner</span></p>

<p>What do you mean?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Lawyer</span></p>

<p>Simply that public feeling has got to swing toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
you or the jury will say you murdered Erwalt. If we
can’t have an alibi, let us by all means have a hero!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Prisoner</span></p>

<p>[<em>Outraged.</em>] Have you given out a story to the
newspapers?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Lawyer</span></p>

<p>[<em>Drawing paper from his pocket.</em>] Very delicately
done. “A life for a life.” Isn’t that moving?
“While Gordon Wallace languishes in his cell, some
woman is safe in a shielded home. Charged with the
murder of John Erwalt, young Wallace fails to cut
his chain of circumstantial evidence with an alibi.
Where was Gordon Wallace on the night of October
25? He maintains a dogged silence. Behind that
silence rests a woman’s honor”&mdash;and so on, at some
length.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Prisoner</span></p>

<p>You had no right to give out a story without my
consent!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Lawyer</span></p>

<p>Oh, yes, I have. If I can’t get your consent for
saving your life, then, my young friend, I shall save
it without your consent. Pardon my rudeness.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Prisoner</span></p>

<p>How will this save it?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Lawyer</span></p>

<p>How little romantic young men know the romantic
sex. Wives&mdash;including, I hope, jurors’ wives&mdash;will
cry, “Don’t let that chivalrous young man die!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Women just love to have their honor shielded. It is
very touching to them.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Prisoner</span></p>

<p>Mr. Foster, I tell you again, I dislike your attitude
toward women! Laugh at me if you will, but I have
respect and reverence for women. I believe it is
perfectly true that men must guard them. Call me
a romantic young fool if it pleases you, but I have
had a mother&mdash;a sister&mdash;sweetheart. Yes, I am
ready to die to shield a woman’s honor!</p>

<p class="sd">[<em>As he says this the door slowly opens
and a woman steps in.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Shielded One</span></p>

<p>No! You shall not!</p>

<p class="sd">[<em>Quite taken aback, the men stand looking

she is feeling some big new thing.

<p>Good. This young man&mdash;[<em>He pauses, embarrassed,

<p>So you were thinking of dying for a woman’s honor.

<p>[<em>Startled into speech.</em>] <em>Ruin</em> her life?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Scornful One</span></p>

<p>Why certainly. A life that somebody has died for
is practically a ruined life. For how are you going
to think of it as anything but&mdash;a life that somebody
has died for? [<em>She pulls her chair to a more confidential
angle.</em>] Did it ever strike you as funny that
woman’s honor is only about one thing, and that man’s
honor is about everything but that thing? [<em>After
waiting for the answer which does not come.</em>] Now
woman’s honor means woman’s virtue. But this lady
for whom you propose to die has no virtue.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Prisoner</span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Scornful One</span></p>

<p>I’m being very careful. I’m thinking it out just
as carefully as I can. The night of October 25,
or at some time previous to that, she lost her virtue,
and you propose to die to keep us from knowing
about this loss. Now, it <em>has</em> happened, hasn’t it? On
the night of October 25, from twelve o’clock midnight
till eight next morning continuously she lost
her virtue. You aren’t dying to keep her virtuous. I
fancy few lives have been laid upon that altar. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
you’re dying to keep us from knowing she is what she

<p>Oh, I have children of my own. I thought, he’s
just a nice boy, and probably she’s just some nice
girl afraid of her mother. And I thought&mdash;well,
now what an awful pity to let him die, or even spend
a lot of time in prison. I said to myself, it would
be just like a lot of men to fuss around about a
woman’s honor and really let it hurt somebody. So I
decided&mdash;well, I’ll go. What harm can it do me?
[<em>Resumes her knitting.</em>] You see, I’m in the habit

I didn’t happen to be on a case just now,

of the folks I nurse for may be shocked&mdash;but good
sensible nurses aren’t so easy to get. Of course my
children may be upset about it&mdash;but they’re awful
nice children, and when they’re a little older probably
they’ll be pleased to think their mother didn’t want
a nice boy to die. [<em>Drops her knitting.</em>] I wonder

so many things&mdash;stupidity, selfishness&mdash;greed, lust,
avarice, gluttony. So without it you’re almost forced
to be a decent sort&mdash;and that’s sometimes wearing.
[<em>In another voice.</em>] But I’ll tell you why I’m really
here! When men begin to sob around about woman’s
honor they get my goat. That lawyer&mdash;he thought

<p>Well now, Ladies, let us drop personal dissentions
for the moment. This unfortunate young man, Mr.
Wallace, is much moved by your generosity. He had
made up his mind to die for woman’s honor. Now it
seems he is not to do so&mdash;a change of plan to which
he has not yet adjusted himself. His perturbation
makes him unequal to selecting the lady who was with
him on the night of October 25. [<em>Door swings,

a man I wanted by a man who would have what he
wanted. Then he saved my woman’s honor. Married
me and cheated me out of my life. I’m just
something to be cheated. That’s the way I think of
myself. Until this morning. Until I read about Gordon

<h2>BERNICE</h2>


<h3>ACT ONE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <em>The living-room of Bernice’s house in the
country. You feel yourself in the house of a woman
you would like to know, a woman of sure and beautiful
instincts, who lives simply. At the spectator’s right,
stairs go up from the living room; back of this&mdash;right,
rear, a door; to the front of the stairs is a narrowed
passage as of a hall leading to the kitchen. On
the other side of the room, is a tea-table before the
fireplace, and before it is a low rounded chair, as if
awaiting the one who will come to serve tea. Toward
the rear of this left wall is a door. This door is closed.
From the back of the room French windows lead directly
out of doors. On each side of this door is a
window thus opening almost the entire wall to the
October woods. There are comfortable seats under
the windows, books about. It is late afternoon and
the sun glows through the flaming leaves. As the
curtain is drawn the <span class="smcap">Father</span> is seen sitting at a long
table at the side of the stairway, playing solitaire.
At the back of the cards, open books are propped
against the wall, and papers on which he has been
writing. <span class="smcap">Abbie</span>, a middle-aged servant, is attending
to the open fire.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>[<em>Holding up a card he is about to place.</em>] Ten
minutes since the train whistled. They’ll be here in
five minutes now.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>It will be hard for Craig to come in this house,
Abbie.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>Oh, yes.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>Bernice made this house. [<em>Looking around.</em>]
Everything is Bernice. [<em>A pause.</em>] Change something,
Abbie! [<em>With growing excitement.</em>] Put
something in a different place. [<em>He takes a pillow
from the seat under the window, holds it irresolutely
a moment, puts it on the floor at the side of the fireplace.
On the other side he moves a high vase from
the window. Then helplessly.</em>] Well, I don’t know.
You can’t get Bernice out of this room. The tea-table!
Come, Abbie, quick! We will take this <em>out</em>
of the room. [<em>Together, <span class="smcap">Abbie</span> reluctant, they move
it to the passage-way leading out from the living-room.
The <span class="smcap">Father</span> comes back and sees the chair, now without
its table. He goes as if to move it, but cannot
do this; looks old and broken as he faces the closed
door.</em>] I wish they’d left Bernice upstairs, Abbie,
in her own room. Now <em>there</em>&mdash;so near the living-room&mdash;right
off the living-room. [<em>Hastily goes back
to his cards, but in an instant he brushes them together
and pulls the open book toward him, and papers; but
he only rests his hand on the book.</em>] There’ll be only
Craig and his sister on this train, Abbie.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>That’s all I know of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>But Margaret Pierce will be here soon. As soon
as she can get here, Margaret will come. Within an
hour, probably.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>[<em>Apprehensive.</em>] You think so, sir?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>I think so. That train from the West got to the
Junction at three. I have a feeling Margaret won’t
wait for the five o’clock train to get here. She’ll get
a car. [<em><span class="smcap">Abbie</span> goes to the door and looks out.</em>] It
would save a little time, and&mdash;she doesn’t know that
Bernice&mdash;Yes, Margaret will get here the quickest
way. She always came to Bernice when Bernice
needed her.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>She doesn’t need anyone now.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>No. But yes&mdash;in a way, she does. She needs
some one to be here to do what she can’t go on doing.
Margaret will see that&mdash;when she knows. Margaret
sees everything.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>[<em>Frightened now.</em>] You think so, sir?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>Oh, yes, she does. Bernice knew that. “Margaret
sees things,” I’ve heard Bernice say. [<em><span class="smcap">Abbie</span> turns
from him.</em>] Now Mrs. Kirby, Craig’s sister Laura,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
she’s a sensible woman, she’ll be a help to you, Abbie,
in&mdash;arranging things. But see things? No. How
different people are. They’re all different, Abbie. I
don’t think Bernice cared much for Laura&mdash;though
she didn’t mind her. She’d just laugh about Laura&mdash;about
her being so sure of everything. It was nice,
Abbie, the way Bernice would just laugh about things.
She had no malice.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>[<em>Strangely intense.</em>] No. She didn’t have, did
she?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>Oh, no, Abbie. Malice wasn’t in her. It was just
that a good many things&mdash;well, the things that are
important to most people weren’t so important to
Bernice. It was another set of things were important.
People called her detached. But&mdash;I don’t know.
Maybe <em>they’re</em> detached, Abbie. Maybe it’s Laura
Kirby, the sensible woman, who’s detached,&mdash;Bernice
would have laughed at that&mdash;the practical person
who’s detached, and Bernice.... You know what
I mean, Abbie?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>I think I do&mdash;knowing her.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>To you&mdash;did she seem detached?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>[<em>Tenderly thinking it out.</em>] She was loving, and
thoughtful, and gay. But always a little of what she
is now&mdash;[<em>Faces the closed door</em>] off by herself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
[<em>With that intensity the present moment does not account
for.</em>] You can’t expect to understand a person
who is “off by herself.” Now can you?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>I understood Bernice. Except, there were things&mdash;outside
what I understood.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>[<em>Eagerly.</em>] That’s it. And we should take what
<em>we</em> had, shouldn’t we, and not try to reach into&mdash;to
where we didn’t go.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>I suppose that’s true, Abbie. [<em>Buries his face.</em>]
I wish my little girl hadn’t died. What am I going
to do, Abbie? How can I stay here? And how can
I go away? We should die in our proper order; I
should have gone before my daughter. Anything else
makes confusion. There’s not going to be anybody to
laugh at me now, Abbie. I’ll miss the way Bernice
laughed at me, a laugh that took me in and&mdash;yes, took
me in. She laughed at my spending the whole time
of the war studying Sanscrit. Well, why shouldn’t
I? What can the old do about war? I had my vision
of life. If that had been followed there’d have been
no war. But in a world that won’t have visions&mdash;why
not study Sanscrit while such a world is being
made over&mdash;into another such world. [<em>Listening.</em>]
You hear some one, Abbie?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>[<em>After listening.</em>] It didn’t turn in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>And you, Abbie. [<em>With wonder.</em>] Why you were
with us when Bernice was born.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>Yes, I was&mdash;in the room the night she was born.
The night she died I thought of the night she was
born.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>That was&mdash;how long ago, Abbie?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>Thirty-five years ago.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>Was Bernice thirty-five years old? She <em>was</em>, Abbie&mdash;my
little girl? Well, life moves by&mdash;and we
hardly know it’s moving. Why, Abbie, your whole
life has been lived around Bernice. [<em><span class="smcap">Abbie</span> nods.</em>]
It will be now as if things had&mdash;fallen apart. And
it was the main thing in your life&mdash;doing things for
her.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>[<em>With excitement.</em>] Yes, it was the <em>main</em> thing in
my life&mdash;doing what she wanted. I couldn’t do anything
else now, could I?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>[<em>A little surprised at her agitation, but not thinking
about it.</em>] Why, no. Now some one is coming, Abbie.
You hear them coming?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>I think so. [<em>She goes to the door.</em>] Yes.</p>

<p class="sd">[<em><span class="smcap">Abbie</span> opens the door and <span class="smcap">Laura</span> and

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>In a minute or two. [<em>He sits down&mdash;on the edge
of a chair near the door. The <span class="smcap">Father</span> and husband
sit there silent.</em>] Bernice&mdash;hadn’t been sick long, had
she?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>No, it was very sudden. You know she had had
trouble occasionally in the past year; Dr. Willis had
said she might have to go to the hospital. At first
this seemed like that&mdash;so Abbie and I weren’t really
alarmed. Of course we sent for Willis, but he was in
Boston. Young Stuart had the grip. So there was no
doctor here&mdash;till afterwards.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>And&mdash;how long was Bernice sick?</p>

<p class="sd">[<em>He speaks with difficulty.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>She spoke of feeling badly on Tuesday. She was
lying down most of that day. Wednesday&mdash;she didn’t
get up at all Wednesday. And she died late Wednesday
night. [<em>Emotion breaking through.</em>] Abbie and
I were here all alone!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>[<em>Changing to something not so hard to speak of.</em>]
You landed last week?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>Yes, I was held in New York by things to do. [<em>A
glance at the <span class="smcap">Father</span>.</em>] Of course, if I had had any
idea&mdash;</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>Of course.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>But Bernice wrote me she was fine.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>She seemed so. She was well and&mdash;seemed very
happy here this fall. You know how she loves to
tramp the woods in the fall. She was counting on
your coming home. She had done over your room
upstairs. And hers too. They both look so nice and
fresh. And she was just starting to do some things
to Margaret’s room. Margaret was coming next
month for a rest. She’s been working very hard.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>Are you expecting Margaret now?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>Yes. Wednesday evening Bernice seemed to want
Margaret to come. She thought maybe Margaret
could get away now, and that it would do her good too.
She had been worrying about her&mdash;thinking she was
working too hard. Margaret’s been in Chicago, you
know, working on some labor things&mdash;I never know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
just what it is she is doing. Bernice seemed to want
to see her. I wonder if Bernice herself felt it was
more than we knew. Anyway, she wanted us to send
for Margaret.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>But you didn’t send for me until&mdash;until it was over.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>No. You see we didn’t know&mdash;Abbie and I didn’t
have any idea&mdash;I spoke of sending for you when we
sent the telegram for Margaret, but Bernice said you’d
be here soon anyway, and she didn’t want to hurry you
away from New York. [<em>As if not understanding it
himself, and trying to find an explanation.</em>] I suppose
you were doing something that she knew about, and
didn’t want to interrupt.</p>

<p class="sd">[<em><span class="smcap">Craig</span> half looks at him.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>And Margaret answered that she was coming?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>Yes, we heard from her Thursday morning that
she had started. She could get here today. We didn’t
know where to reach her telling her it was too late now
for&mdash;for the visit with Bernice. [<em>Breaking.</em>] I just
can’t believe it! Think of what you and I are talking
about! Bernice, <em>out</em> of life. She was so&mdash;<em>of</em> it.
Didn’t you feel that, Craig&mdash;about Bernice?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>Yes. She seemed so&mdash;secured. It never seemed
anything could&mdash;destroy Bernice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>When I think she won’t come down those stairs
again!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>I can’t&mdash;think of things that way now.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>No. No, of course not. [<em>He does not know what
to say, so gathers together his cards, then books.</em>]
I’ll just&mdash;I was just going in my room. [<em>Pause.</em>]
I’ve been getting on fine with my Sanscrit, Craig.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>That’s good.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>And now the war is over, and some of the people
who fussed around about it influenced it as little as I,
and I&mdash;have my Sanscrit. You know, Bernice used
to laugh at me, Craig. She&mdash;the way she used to
laugh at us&mdash;lovingly. Seems to me I’ll miss that
most of all.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>Why, she knew it. Bernice knew I was staying
out on Long Island with them while I was attending
to some things about my work. I had a beautiful
letter from Bernice. She was perfectly all right&mdash;about
everything. And I was anxious now to get
home to her. I was getting ready to start the very
day I got the telegram that&mdash;that it was like this.
You mean&mdash;you think I didn’t make Bernice happy,
Margaret?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Oh, I don’t think you had the power to make her
very unhappy.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>She understood me.</p>

<p>[<em>After a pause.</em>] Margaret, did you ever feel you
didn’t really get <em>to</em> Bernice?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Get to her? So far as I had power. <em>She</em> never
held me back. Life broke through her&mdash;a life deeper
than anything that could happen to her.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>Yes, that’s it. Something you couldn’t destroy. A
life in her deeper than anything that could be done to
her. That&mdash;that makes a difference, Margaret. I
never <em>had</em> Bernice.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Oh, wasn’t it wonderful to you that beneath what
you “had” was a life too full, too rich to be <em>had</em>? I
should think that would flow over your life and give it
beauty.</p>

<p>Abbie! Don’t shut me out like this! <em>She</em> wouldn’t
shut me out. Bernice loved me.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>I know. I know she did. But there’s nothing for
me to tell you, Miss Margaret, and it’s hard for me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
to talk about. I loved her too. I lived with her her
whole life long. First the baby I took care of and
played with&mdash;then all the changing with the different
years&mdash;then <em>this</em>&mdash;</p>

<p class="sd">[<em>A move of her hands towards the closed
door.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Yes&mdash;then this. [<em>Gently.</em>] That’s it, Abbie.
“This”&mdash;takes away from all that. Abbie, do <em>you</em>
understand it? If you do, won’t you help me?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>I don’t understand it.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>It’s something so&mdash;outside all the rest. That’s
why I can’t accept it. Something in me just won’t
take it in&mdash;because it isn’t <em>right</em>. I knew her. I
<em>know</em> I knew her! And this&mdash;Why then I didn’t
know her. Can’t you help me?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>I don’t see how, Miss Margaret.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>But if you would tell me things you know&mdash;little
things&mdash;even though they meant nothing to you they
might mean something to me. Abbie! Because you
loved her don’t you want what she was to go on living
in our hearts?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>Oh, I do! I do! But she’ll go on living in my
heart without my understanding what she did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>But differently. I’ll tell you what I mean. Everything
about her has always been&mdash;herself. That was
one of the rare things about her. And herself&mdash;oh,
it’s something you don’t want to lose! It’s been the
beauty in my life. In my busy practical life, Bernice&mdash;what
she was&mdash;like a breath that blew over my
life and&mdash;made it something.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>I know&mdash;just what you mean, Miss Margaret.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>It’s inconceivable that she should&mdash;cut off her own
life. In her lived all the life that was behind her.
You felt that in her&mdash;so wonderfully. She felt it
in herself&mdash;or her eyes couldn’t have been like that.
<em>Could</em> they? Could they, Abbie?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>It&mdash;wouldn’t seem so.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>She wouldn’t destroy so <em>much</em>. Why she never
destroyed anything&mdash;a flower&mdash;a caterpillar. Don’t
you see what I mean, Abbie? This denies so <em>much</em>.
And then is it true that all this time she wasn’t happy?
Why she seemed happy&mdash;as trees grow. Did Mr.
Norris make her unhappy? Oh, don’t think you
shouldn’t talk about it. Don’t act as if I shouldn’t
ask. It’s too big for those little scruples. Abbie!
I can’t let Bernice’s life go out in darkness. So tell
me&mdash;just what happened&mdash;each little thing. [<em><span class="smcap">Margaret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></span>

<p>Margaret, what is to be gained in making people feel
worse than they need? Craig upstairs&mdash;he’s so

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>I don’t do it to them. I’m not very happy myself.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Laura</span></p>

<p>Of course not. None of us can be that. But I
believe we should try to bear things with courage.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>That comes easily from the person who’s bearing
little!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Laura</span></p>

<p>You think it means nothing to me that my brother

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Your brother has lost his wife! That’s all <em>you</em> see
in it!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Laura</span></p>

<p>I don’t see why you seem so wild&mdash;so resentful,
Margaret. Death should soften us.</p>

<p class="sd">[<em>She takes her old place before the fire.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Well I can tell you this doesn’t soften me!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Laura</span></p>

<p>I see that you feel hard toward Craig. But Bernice
didn’t. You think he should have come right home.
But you must be just enough to admit he didn’t have
any idea Bernice was going to be taken suddenly sick.
He had been out of the country for three months,
naturally there were things connected with his writing
to see about.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Connected with his writing! Laura! Don’t <em>lie</em>
about life with death in the next room. If you want
to talk at a time like this, have the decency to be
honest! Try to see the <em>truth</em> about living. Craig
stayed in New York with May Fredericks&mdash;and he
doesn’t pretend anything else. Stayed there with May
Fredericks, continuing an affair that has been going on
for the past year. And before it was May Fredericks
it was this one and that one. Well, all right. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
may be all right. I’m not condemning Craig for his
affairs. I’m condemning you for the front you’re
trying to put up!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Laura</span></p>

<p>I certainly am not trying to put up any front. It’s
merely that there seems nothing to be gained in speaking
of certain things. If Craig was&mdash;really unfaithful,
I do condemn him for that. I haven’t your liberal
ideas. [<em>Slight pause, she takes up her knitting.</em>] It’s
unfortunate Bernice hadn’t the power to hold Craig.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Hadn’t the power to hold Craig!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Laura</span></p>

<p>She didn’t want to&mdash;I suppose your scoffing means.
Well, she should have wanted to. It’s what a wife
should want to do.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Oh, Laura, Bernice will never say one more word
for herself! In there. Alone. Still. She will not
do one new thing to&mdash;to throw a light back on other
things. That’s death. A <em>leaving</em> of one’s life. Leaving
it&mdash;with us. I cannot talk to you about what
Bernice “should have been.” What she was came
true and deep from&mdash;[<em>Throwing out her hands as
if giving up saying it. Taking it up again.</em>] It’s true
there was something in her Craig did not control.
Something he couldn’t <em>mess up</em>. There was something
in her he might have drawn from and become bigger
than he was. But he’s vain. He has to be bowling
some one over all the time&mdash;to show that he has <em>power</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Laura</span></p>

<p>I don’t agree with you that Craig is especially vain.
He’s a man. He does want to affect&mdash;yes, dominate
the woman he loves. And if Bernice didn’t give him
that feeling of&mdash;</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Supremacy.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Laura</span></p>

<p>There’s no use trying to talk with you of personal
things. Certainly I don’t want to quarrel tonight.
That would not be the thing. [<em>In a new tone.</em>] How
is your work going? I don’t quite know what you
are doing now, but trying to get some one out of prison,
I suppose?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Yes; I am trying to get out of prison all those
people who are imprisoned for ideas.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Laura</span></p>

<p>I see.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>I doubt if you see, Laura.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Laura</span></p>

<p>Well I don’t say I sympathize. But I see.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>No; for if you did see, you would have to sympathize.
If you did see, you would be ashamed; you
would have to&mdash;hang your head for this thing of
locking any man up because of what his mind sees. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
thinking is not to become&mdash;whatever thinking may
become!&mdash;then why are we here at all? [<em>She stops
and thinks of it.</em>] Why does Bernice&mdash;her death&mdash;make
that so simple tonight? Because she was
herself. She had the gift for being herself. And she
wanted each one to have the chance to be himself.
Anything else hurt her&mdash;as it hurt her to see a dog
tied, or a child at a narrow window.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Laura</span></p>

<p>I don’t think Bernice was a very good wife for a
writer.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>She would have been a wonderful wife for a real
writer.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Laura</span></p>

<p>Oh, I know she didn’t value Craig’s work. And
that’s another thing. And I suppose you don’t value
it either. [<em>She looks at <span class="smcap">Margaret</span>, who does not
speak.</em>] Fortunately there are many thousands of people
in this country who do value it. And I suppose
you think what I do of little value too. I suppose
you scoff at those things we do to put cripples back
in life.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>No, Laura, I don’t scoff at anything that can be
done for cripples. Since men have been crippled,
cripples must be helped. I only say&mdash;Don’t cripple
minds&mdash;strong free minds that might go&mdash;we know
not where! Might go into places where the light of
a mind has never been. [<em>Rising.</em>] Think of it!
Think of that chance of making life even greater than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
death. [<em>With passion.</em>] If you have any respect for
life&mdash;any reverence&mdash;you have to leave the mind
free. I do not scoff at you, but you are not a serious
person. You have no faith&mdash;no hope&mdash;no self-respect!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Laura</span></p>

<p>[<em>Rising.</em>] <em>You</em> tell me I have no self-respect! You
who have not cared what people thought of you&mdash;who
have not had the sense of fitness&mdash;the taste&mdash;to
hold the place you were born to&mdash;you tell me,
against whom no word was ever spoken, that I have
no self-respect?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>You have a blameless reputation, Laura. You have
no self-respect. If you had any respect for your own
mind you could not be willing to limit the mind of any
other. If you had any respect for your own spiritual
life you could not be willing to push <em>your</em> self into
the spiritual life of another. [<em>Roughly.</em>] No!
You could not. [<em>As one seeing far.</em>] I see it as I
never saw it. Oh I wish I could talk to Bernice!
Something is <em>down</em>. I could see things as I never
saw them.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Laura</span></p>

with.</em>] I will go before I am insulted further.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>There’s nothing insulting in trying to find the truth.
[<em>Impulsively reaching out her hands to <span class="smcap">Laura</span>, as she

We live so in the dark. We never become what we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

him happy in that life he made for himself away from

just didn’t go on, did he? Made a fight in his youth,

Darwinian theory. Spent himself fighting for it, and&mdash;let
it go at that. [<em>Running his hand through his

her now as a baby. She was such a nice baby. She
used to&mdash;reach out her hands. [<em>Doing this himself.</em>]

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>Well, that isn’t right, Margaret. You want to feel
that you <em>have</em> the woman you love. Yes&mdash;completely.
Yes, every bit of her!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>So you turned to women whom you could have.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>But you “had” all of them simply because there
was less to have. You want no baffling sense of something
beyond you. [<em>He looks at her reproachfully.</em>]
You wanted me to help you find the truth. I don’t
believe you can stand truth, Craig.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>It’s hard tonight.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>[<em>Intensely.</em>] But perhaps it is tonight or not at all.
It’s a strange thing this has done. A light trying
to find its way through a fog. [<em>In her mind the light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"><span class="normalfont">[198]</span></a></span>
tries to do this.</em>] Craig, why do you write the things
you do?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>Oh, Margaret, is this any time to talk of work?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>It seems to be. Tonight it’s all part of the same
thing. Laura and I were talking of work&mdash;quarreling
about it: you were talking of Bernice’s father.
The light&mdash;just goes there. That poor sad old man&mdash;why
didn’t he go on? You said he was a wreck of
the Darwinian theory. Then me&mdash;a wreck of free
speech.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>Oh I didn’t mean you were, Margaret.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>But I might be. I can see that. We give ourselves
in fighting for a thing that seems important and
in that fight we get out of the flow of life. We had
meant it to deepen the flow&mdash;but we get caught. I
know people like that. People who get at home in
their fight&mdash;and stay there&mdash;and are left there when
the fight’s over&mdash;like this old man. How many nights
Bernice and I have sat in this room and talked of
things! And I had thought&mdash;[<em>With sudden angry
passion.</em>] If you had been good to her, she would
be in this room now. [<em>After a look at him.</em>] I’m
sorry. But can I help feeling it?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>I didn’t know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>No; you didn’t know. We don’t know. When you
think what a writer might do for life&mdash;for we <em>don’t</em>
know. You write so well, Craig, but&mdash;what of it?
What is it is the matter with you&mdash;with all you
American writers&mdash;’most all of you. A well-put-up
light&mdash;but it doesn’t penetrate anything. It never
makes the fog part. Just shows itself off&mdash;a well-put-up
light. [<em>Growing angry.</em>] It would be better
if we didn’t have you at all! Can’t you see that it
would? Lights which&mdash;only light themselves keep
us from having light&mdash;from knowing what the darkness
is. [<em>After thinking.</em>] Craig, as you write these
things are there never times when you sit there <em>dumb</em>
and know that you are glib and empty?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>Did you ever try to write, Margaret?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>I suppose you think it’s very simple to be real. I
suppose you think we could do it&mdash;if we just wanted
to do it. Try it. You try.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>So you do this just to cover the fact that you <em>can’t</em>
do anything? Your skill&mdash;a mask for your lack
of power?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>I should think you’d want to be good to me tonight,
Margaret.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Be good to you! Keep you from seeing. That’s
the way we’re good to each other. There’s only one
thing I could do for you tonight, Craig. You don’t
want that. So&mdash;</p>

<p class="sd">[<em>Moves as if to rise.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>No, don’t go away. My brain won’t keep still either.
What I think is just as bad as what you say. Well,
why do you think it is I&mdash;miss things&mdash;never get
anywhere?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>I don’t know. And it’s true of all of us. Of me
too. I do things that to me seem important, and yet
I just do <em>them</em>&mdash;I don’t get to the thing I’m doing
them for&mdash;to life itself. I don’t simply and profoundly
get to <em>life</em>. Bernice did.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>Yes. Bernice did.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>And yet you had to&mdash;shy away from Bernice. Into
a smaller world that could be all your world. No,
Craig, you haven’t power. It’s true. And for one
hour in our lives let’s try to&mdash;Those love affairs of
yours&mdash;they’re like your false writing&mdash;to keep
yourself from knowing you haven’t power. Did you
ever see a child try to do a thing&mdash;fail&mdash;then turn
to something he could do and make a great show of
doing that? That’s what most of our lives are like.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>[<em>Rudely.</em>] Well, why <em>haven’t</em> I power? If you are
going to be any good to me&mdash;tell me that.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>[<em>Shaking her head.</em>] I can’t tell you that. I
haven’t any light that&mdash;goes there. But isn’t it true?
Isn’t your life this long attempt to appear effective&mdash;to
persuade yourself that you <em>are</em> something? What
a way to spend the little time there is for living.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>I fancy it’s the way most lives are spent.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>That only makes it infinitely sadder.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>[<em>As if he can stay in this no longer.</em>] As to writing,
Margaret, the things that interest you wouldn’t
interest most people.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>“Wouldn’t interest most people!” Oh, Craig, don’t
slide away from that one honest moment. Say you
haven’t got it. Don’t say they wouldn’t want it.
Why, if now&mdash;in this our day&mdash;our troubled day of
many shadows&mdash;came a light&mdash;a light to reach those
never lighted places&mdash;wouldn’t <em>want</em> it? I wish
some one could try them! No, Craig, they all have
their times of suspecting their lives are going by in a
fog. They’re <em>pitifully</em> anxious for a little light.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
Why&mdash;they continue to look to <em>writers</em>. You know,
Craig, what living makes of us&mdash;it’s a rim&mdash;a
bounded circle&mdash;and yet we know&mdash;have our times
of suspecting&mdash;that if we could break through <em>that</em>.
[<em>Seeing.</em>] O-h. It’s like living in the mountains&mdash;those
high vast places of Colorado&mdash;in a little house
with shaded windows. You’d <em>suspect</em> what was there!
A little sunshine through the cracks&mdash;mountain smells&mdash;and
at times the house would shake&mdash;and you’d
wonder&mdash;and be fretted in your little room. And if
some day you could put up the shade and&mdash;<em>see where
you were</em>. Life would never be so small a thing again.
Bernice could do that. Her own life did not bound
her.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>No. That was what&mdash;</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Hurt your vanity?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>I don’t know. I’m trying to be honest. I honestly
don’t know.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>No. We don’t know. That’s why&mdash;oh, Craig, it
would be so wonderful to be a writer&mdash;something
that gets a little farther than others can get&mdash;gets
at least the edge of the shadow. [<em>After her own
moment on the edge of the shadow.</em>] If you ever
felt the shock of reality, and <em>got</em> that back in you&mdash;you
wouldn’t be thinking of whom it would “interest”!
But, Craig&mdash;<em>this</em>. [<em>A movement toward the closed
room.</em>] Doesn’t <em>this</em> give you that shock of reality?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>What of <em>you</em>? Doesn’t it give it to you? You’re
speaking as if this hadn’t happened! You leave it
out&mdash;what Bernice did because of me. You’re talking
of my having no power. What of <em>this</em>? <em>Had</em>
I no power? [<em>After her look at him.</em>] Oh, yes&mdash;I
know I used it terribly&mdash;plenty of years for my
heart to break over that. But can you say I didn’t
<em>have</em> it?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>I do leave it out. It isn’t right there should be
anything in Bernice not Bernice. And she had a great
rightness&mdash;rightness without effort&mdash;that rare, rare
thing.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>You say it isn’t right&mdash;and so you leave it out?
And then <em>you</em> talk about the shock of reality.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>I don’t say it isn’t fact. I say it isn’t&mdash;<em>in the
rightness</em>.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>“In the rightness!” Is that for you to say? Is
rightness what you think? What you can see? No.
You didn’t know Bernice. You didn’t know she loved
me&mdash;<em>that way</em>. And I didn’t know. But she did!
How <em>could</em> I have had that&mdash;and not <em>known</em>? But
I <em>did</em> have it! I did <em>have</em> it! You say life broke
through her&mdash;the whole of life. But Bernice didn’t
want&mdash;the whole of life. She wanted <em>me</em>. [<em>He goes
to the door, bows against it, all sorrow and need.</em>]<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
I want to talk to <em>her</em>&mdash;not you. I want her <em>now</em>&mdash;<em>knowing</em>.</p>

<p class="sd">[<em>He opens that door and goes in to Bernice.
<span class="smcap">Margaret</span> stands motionless,
searching, and as if something is
coming to her from the rightness.

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>No! I say&mdash;No! [<em>Feeling some one behind her,

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>That it isn’t true. That she didn’t do it.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Didn’t do it? Did <em>not</em> take her own life?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>No. Of course she didn’t.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>[<em>Still very slowly, as if much more is coming than
she can take in.</em>] Then <em>why</em>&mdash;did you say she did?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>Because she said I must. Oh&mdash;look at me! Look
at me! But you knew her. You know the strength
of her. If she’d told you the way she told me&mdash;<em>you’d
have done it too</em>. You would!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>[<em>Saying each word by itself.</em>] I can not understand
one word you’re saying. Something is wrong with
you. [<em>Changing, and roughly taking hold of <span class="smcap">Abbie</span>.</em>]
Tell me. Quick, the truth.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>Wednesday night, about eight o’clock, about an hour
after she told me to telegraph you, she said, “Why,
Abbie, I believe I’m going to die.” I said no, but she
said, “I think so.” I said we’d send for Mr. Norris.
She said no, and not to frighten her father. I&mdash;<em>I</em>
didn’t think she was going to die. All the time I was
trying to get the doctor. There were two hours when
she was&mdash;quiet. Quiet&mdash;not like any quiet I ever
knew. Thinking. You could see thinking in her eyes&mdash;stronger
than sickness. Then, after ten, she called
me to her. She took my hands. She said, “Abbie,
you’ve lived with me all my life.” “Yes,” I said.
“You love me.” “Oh, yes,” I said. “Will you do
something for me?” “You know I will,” I told her.
“Abbie,” she said, looking right at me, <em>all</em> of her
looking right at me, “if I die, I want you to tell my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
husband I killed myself.” [<em><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> falls back.</em>]
Yes, I did that too. Then I thought it was her mind.
But I looked at her, and oh, her mind was there! It
was terrible&mdash;how it was all <em>there</em>. She said&mdash;and
then she [<em>The sobs she has been holding back almost
keep <span class="smcap">Abbie</span> from saying this</em>]&mdash;held out her hands to
me&mdash;“Oh, Abbie, do this last thing for me! After
all there has been, I have a <em>right</em> to do it. If my life is
going&mdash;let me have <em>this</em> much from it!” And as still
I couldn’t&mdash;<em>couldn’t</em>&mdash;the tears ran down her face
and she said, “I want to rest before pain comes again.
Promise me so I can rest.” And I promised. And
you would have too!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>You don’t know what you’re <em>telling</em> me! You don’t
know <em>what</em> you’re doing. You do this <em>now</em>&mdash;after
she can do nothing? [<em>Holding out her hands.</em>]
Abbie! Tell me it isn’t true!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>It’s true.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>You are telling me her life was <em>hate</em>? [<em>Stops, half
turns to the room where <span class="smcap">Craig</span> is with Bernice.</em>] You
are telling me she covered hate with&mdash;with the beauty
that was like nothing else? Abbie! <em>You</em> are telling
me that as Bernice left life she <em>held out her hands</em> and
asked you to take <em>this</em> back for her?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>There are things we can’t understand. There’s no

<h3>ACT THREE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <em>The same as in Acts One and Two; it is
early afternoon of the next day; the door leading outdoors
is a little open; when the curtain is drawn <span class="smcap">Craig</span>
is seen outside, just passing the window, as one who
is walking back and forth in thinking. In the room
are <span class="smcap">Laura</span> and the <span class="smcap">Father</span>&mdash;the <span class="smcap">Father</span> sitting at
the table by the stairs&mdash;<span class="smcap">Laura</span>, standing, watches
<span class="smcap">Craig</span> pass the door; she has in her hand a paper on
which are some memoranda. After watching <span class="smcap">Craig</span>
she sighs, looks at her notes, sits down.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Laura</span></p>

<p>I’m sorry to be troubling you, Mr. Allen. Certainly
you should not be asked to discuss these matters about&mdash;arrangements.
But really, you and I seem the only
people who are capable of going on with things. I
must say, I don’t know what to make of everyone else.
They all seem to be trying to&mdash;keep away from one.
I think that’s a little unnecessary. Of course I know
what grief does, and I’m sure I have every consideration
for that, but really&mdash;I’m sorry Craig keeps his
own sister out. When I’m here to help him. And
Abbie&mdash;why she seems to have lost her head. Just
when it’s so important that she look after things. And
as to Margaret Pierce&mdash;she certainly is worse than
useless. I don’t see what she came for if she didn’t
want to be helpful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>Margaret and Bernice were very dear friends, Laura.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Laura</span></p>

<p>Is that any reason for not being helpful in Bernice’s
household at a time like this? Really I do like control.
[<em>After looking at her notes.</em>] Then the minister will
come here at three, Mr. Allen. Why that will be little
more than an hour! Think of things having been neglected
like this! [<em>As <span class="smcap">Craig</span>, having turned in his walk,
is again passing the door.</em>] Craig! [<em>He steps to the
door.</em>] The minister, Mr. Howe, will come here,
Craig, at three.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>What for?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Laura</span></p>

<p>Craig! What <em>for</em>?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>I don’t see why he comes here. Why Bernice
scarcely knew him. [<em>To her father.</em>] Did Bernice
know him?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>Well, I don’t know whether she knew him, but&mdash;</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Laura</span></p>

<p>It is not a personal matter, Craig.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>I think it is. Very personal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Laura</span></p>

<p>You mean to say you are not going to have any
<em>service</em>?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>I haven’t thought anything about it. Oh, Laura!
How can I think of such things now?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Laura</span></p>

<p>Well, I will think of them for you, dear.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>Don’t bring him here. He can go&mdash;[<em>Stops</em>] there,
if he wants to. Where&mdash;we have to go. Not here.
In her own house. The very last thing.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>I’m afraid it will seem strange, Craig.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Craig</span></p>

<p>Strange? Do I care if it seems strange? Bernice
seemed strange too. But she wasn’t strange. She
was wonderful. [<em>Putting out his hand impatiently.</em>]
Oh, <em>no</em>, Laura. There’s so much else to think of&mdash;now.</p>

<p class="sd">[<em>He steps out of the door and stands
there, his back to the room.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>[<em>In a low voice.</em>] I wonder&mdash;could we go somewhere
else? Into my room, perhaps. I’m afraid we
are keeping Craig out of here. And I think he wants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>No. I didn’t <em>know</em>. I didn’t know. It didn’t come

<p class="sd">[<em>A laugh.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>I’ve lost my seeing. It was through her I saw. It

a thing he shouldn’t have to bear. Why that feeling
has made my life! Do you think I’ve <em>wanted</em> to do the
kind of work I do? Don’t you think I’d like to be
doing&mdash;happier things? But there’s something in my
blood <em>drives</em> me to&mdash;what’s right.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>And something in <em>my</em> blood drives me to what’s
right! And I went against it&mdash;went against my

loved her. But you didn’t love her.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Oh&mdash;Abbie!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>Not as you love&mdash;what’s right. If you loved her,
don’t you want to protect her&mdash;now that she lies dead
in there? [<em>Her voice breaking.</em>] Oh, Miss Margaret,
it was right at the very <em>end</em> of her life. Maybe when
we’re going to die things we’ve borne all our lives are
things we can’t bear any longer. Just&mdash;don’t count
that last hour.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>[<em>After a moment of being swayed by this.</em>] Yet
you counted it, Abbie. You did what she said&mdash;because

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

she seemed to feel&mdash;what she didn’t feel. She did
it well, didn’t she?&mdash;and almost to the last. Shan’t
we hide it now? For her? You and me, who loved
her&mdash;isn’t she <em>safe</em>&mdash;with us? [<em>Going nearer <span class="smcap">Margaret</span>.</em>]
Perhaps if you would go in there now&mdash;</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Oh no&mdash;no.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Abbie</span></p>

<p>Yes, I think you are too. I can see myself as I’d
have been if my life hadn’t been lived round her.
[<em>Thinks, shakes her head.</em>] It would be left you&mdash;what
feels and knows it feels. And you said it was
through Bernice you could see. Well, lets forget what
we don’t want to know! On account of what we are

had called to me. Abbie and I were in there
and&mdash;Abbie went out, about the telephone call we
had in for the doctor. I was all alone in there a few

word, Margaret. Your name.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Father</span></p>

<p>No, I wouldn’t say she called to you. Just said
your name. The way we say things to ourselves&mdash;say
them without knowing we were going to say them.

[<em>Pause. <span class="smcap">Margaret</span> seems to try to speak, but does

things. [<em>He speaks out of pain, but out of pain which

Those big impersonal things&mdash;they were not apart.

<h2>SUPPRESSED DESIRES</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Scene I</span>: <em>A studio apartment in an upper story,
Washington Square South. Through an immense
north window in the back wall appear tree tops and
the upper part of the Washington Arch. Beyond it
you look up Fifth Avenue. Near the window is a
big table, loaded at one end with serious-looking books
and austere scientific periodicals. At the other end
are architect’s drawings, blue prints, dividing compasses,
square, ruler, etc. At the left is a door leading
to the rest of the apartment; at the right the outer
door. A breakfast table is set for three, but only
two are seated at it&mdash;<span class="smcap">Henrietta</span> and <span class="smcap">Stephen
Brewster</span>. As the curtains withdraw <span class="smcap">Steve</span> pushes
back his coffee cup and sits dejected.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>It isn’t the coffee, Steve dear. There’s nothing the
matter with the coffee. There’s something the matter
with <em>you</em>.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Steve</span></p>

<p>[<em>Doggedly.</em>] There may be something the matter
with my stomach.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>[<em>Scornfully.</em>] Your stomach! The trouble is not
with your stomach but in your subconscious mind.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Steve</span></p>

<p>Subconscious piffle!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p class="sd">[<em>Takes morning paper and tries to read.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>Steve, you never used to be so disagreeable. You
certainly have got some sort of a complex. You’re all
inhibited. You’re no longer open to new ideas. You
won’t listen to a word about psychoanalysis.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Steve</span></p>

<p>A word! I’ve listened to volumes!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>You’ve ceased to be creative in architecture&mdash;your
work isn’t going well. You’re not sleeping well&mdash;</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Steve</span></p>

<p>How can I sleep, Henrietta, when you’re always
waking me up to find out what I’m dreaming?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>But dreams are so important, Steve. If you’d tell
yours to Dr. Russell he’d find out exactly what’s wrong
with you.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Steve</span></p>

<p>There’s nothing wrong with me.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>You don’t even talk as well as you used to.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Steve</span></p>

<p>Talk? I can’t say a thing without you looking at
me in that dark fashion you have when you’re on
the trail of a complex.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>This very irritability indicates that you’re suffering
from some suppressed desire.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Steve</span></p>

<p>I’m suffering from a suppressed desire for a little
peace.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>Dr. Russell is doing simply wonderful things with
nervous cases. Won’t you go to him, Steve?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Steve</span></p>

<p>[<em>Slamming down his newspaper.</em>] No, Henrietta,
I won’t!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>Oh, yes, I slept all right. Yes, I slept fine last
night, only [<em>Laughing</em>] I did have the funniest dream!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>[<em>Moving closer.</em>] And what did you dream, Mabel?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Steve</span></p>

<p>Look-a-here, Mabel, I feel it’s my duty to put you
on. Don’t tell Henrietta your dreams. If you do
she’ll find out that you have an underground desire to
kill your father and marry your mother&mdash;</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>Don’t be absurd, Stephen Brewster. [<em>Sweetly to
<span class="smcap">Mabel</span>.</em>] What was your dream, dear?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>[<em>Laughing.</em>] Well, I dreamed I was a hen.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>A hen?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>Yes; and I was pushing along through a crowd as
fast as I could, but being a hen I couldn’t walk very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
fast&mdash;it was like having a tight skirt, you know; and
there was some sort of creature in a blue cap&mdash;you
know how mixed up dreams are&mdash;and it kept shouting
after me, “Step, Hen! Step, Hen!” until I got all
excited and just couldn’t move at all.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>[<em>Resting chin in palm and peering.</em>] You say you
became much excited?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>[<em>Laughing.</em>] Oh, yes; I was in a terrible state.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>[<em>Leaning back, murmurs.</em>] This is significant.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Steve</span></p>

<p>She dreams she’s a hen. She is told to step lively.
She becomes violently agitated. What can it mean?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>[<em>Turning impatiently from him.</em>] Mabel, do you
know anything about psychoanalysis?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>[<em>Feebly.</em>] Oh&mdash;not much. No&mdash;I&mdash;[<em>Brightening.</em>]
It’s something about the war, isn’t it?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Steve</span></p>

<p>Not that kind of war.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>[<em>Abashed.</em>] I thought it might be the name of a
new explosive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>Lyman Eggleston?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>Yes, Eggleston. He was in touch with things.
Don’t you see him?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>Yes, I see him once in a while. Bob doesn’t like
him very well.</p>

<p class="sd">[<em><span class="smcap">Steve</span> goes to work-table.</em></p>

<p>Why&mdash;yes&mdash;I guess so. Why&mdash;of course I am!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>Are you happy? Or do you only think you are?
Or do you only think you <em>ought</em> to be?</p>

<p>Why, Henrietta, I don’t know what you mean!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Steve</span></p>

<p>[<em>Seizes stack of books and magazines and dumps

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>But what’s it all about?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Steve</span></p>

<p>All about your sub-un-non-conscious mind and desires
you know not of. They may be doing you a great
deal of harm. You may go crazy with them. Oh,
yes! People are doing it right and left. Your dreaming
you’re a hen&mdash;</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>It’s like this, Mabel. You want something. You
think you can’t have it. You think it’s wrong. So
you try to think you don’t want it. Your mind protects
you&mdash;avoids pain&mdash;by refusing to think the
forbidden thing. But it’s there just the same. It
stays there shut up in your unconscious mind, and it
festers.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Steve</span></p>

<p>Sort of an ingrowing mental toenail.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>Precisely. The forbidden impulse is there full of
energy which has simply got to do something. It
breaks into your consciousness in disguise, masks itself
in dreams, makes all sorts of trouble. In extreme
cases it drives you insane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>[<em>With a gesture of horror.</em>] Oh!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>[<em>Reassuring.</em>] But psychoanalysis has found out
how to save us from that. It brings into consciousness
the suppressed desire that was making all the
trouble. Psychoanalysis is simply the latest scientific
method of preventing and curing insanity.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Steve</span></p>

<p>[<em>From his table.</em>] It is also the latest scientific
method of separating families.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>[<em>Mildly.</em>] Families that ought to be separated.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Steve</span></p>

<p>The Dwights, for instance. You must have met
them, Mabel, when you were here before. Helen was
living, apparently, in peace and happiness with good
old Joe. Well&mdash;she went to this psychoanalyzer&mdash;she
was “psyched,” and biff!&mdash;bang!&mdash;home she
comes with an unsuppressed desire to leave her husband.</p>

<p class="sd">[<em>He starts work, drawing lines on a
drawing board with a T-square.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>How terrible! Yes, I remember Helen Dwight.
But&mdash;but did she have such a desire?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Steve</span></p>

<p>First she’d known of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>And she <em>left</em> him?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>[<em>Coolly.</em>] Yes, she did.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>Wasn’t he kind to her?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>Why yes, good enough.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>Wasn’t he kind to her.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>Oh, yes&mdash;kind to her.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>And she left her good kind husband&mdash;!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>Oh, Mabel! “Left her good, kind husband!”
How naïve&mdash;forgive me, dear, but how bourgeoise
you are! She came to know herself. And she had
the courage!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>I may be very naïve and&mdash;bourgeoise&mdash;but I don’t
see the good of a new science that breaks up homes.</p>

<p class="sd">[<em><span class="smcap">Steve</span> applauds.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Steve</span></p>

<p>In enlightening Mabel, we mustn’t neglect to mention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
the case of Art Holden’s private secretary, Mary
Snow, who has just been informed of her suppressed
desire for her employer.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>Why, I think it is terrible, Henrietta! It would
be better if we didn’t know such things about ourselves.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>No, Mabel, that is the old way.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>But&mdash;but her employer? Is he married?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Steve</span></p>

<p>[<em>Grunts.</em>] Wife and four children.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>Well, then, what good does it do the girl to be told
she has a desire for him? There’s nothing can be
done about it.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>Old institutions will have to be reshaped so that
something can be done in such cases. It happens,
Mabel, that this suppressed desire was on the point of
landing Mary Snow in the insane asylum. Are you
so tight-minded that you’d rather have her in the
insane asylum than break the conventions?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>But&mdash;but have people always had these awful suppressed
desires?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>Always.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Steve</span></p>

<p>But they’ve just been discovered.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>The harm they do has just been discovered. And
free, sane people must face the fact that they have
to be dealt with.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>[<em>Stoutly.</em>] I don’t believe they have them in Chicago.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>[<em>Business of giving <span class="smcap">Mabel</span> up.</em>] People “have
them” wherever the living Libido&mdash;the center of the

and he found himself alone in a forest. Don’t you
see how significant it is for an architect to have <em>walls</em>
slip away from him? It symbolizes his loss of grip in
his work. There’s some suppressed desire&mdash;</p>

<p>You said you are not in touch with things intellectual.
You showed your feeling that it is Bob’s profession&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>

<p>Don’t be afraid of me, little sister. There’s nothing
can shock me or turn me from you. I am not like that.
I wanted you to come for this visit because I had a
feeling that you needed more from life than you were
getting. No one of these things I have seen would
excite my suspicion. It’s the combination. You don’t
eat breakfast [<em>Enumerating on her fingers</em>]; you
make false moves; you substitute your own name for
the name of another <em>whose love is misdirected</em>. You’re
nervous; you <em>look</em> queer; in your eyes there’s a frightened
look that is most unlike you. And this dream.
A <em>hen</em>. Come with me this afternoon to Dr. Russell!
Your whole life may be at stake, Mabel.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>[<em>Gasping.</em>] Henrietta, I&mdash;you&mdash;you always were
the smartest in the family, and all that, but&mdash;this is
terrible! I don’t think we <em>ought</em> to think such things.
[<em>Brightening.</em>] Why, I’ll tell you why I dreamed I
was a hen. It was because last night, telling about
that time in Chicago, you said I was as mad as a wet
hen.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>[<em>Superior.</em>] Did you dream you were a <em>wet</em> hen?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>No. You dreamed you were a <em>dry</em> hen. And why,
being a hen, were you urged to step?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>Maybe it’s because when I am getting on a street
car it always irritates me to have them call “Step
lively.”</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>No, Mabel, that is only a child’s view of it&mdash;if
you will forgive me. You see merely the elements
used in the dream. You do not see into the dream;
you do not see its meaning. This dream of the hen&mdash;</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Steve</span></p>

<p>Oh, I’m not sure I’m wholly out of sympathy with
psychoanalysis, Henrietta. You worked it so hard. I
couldn’t even take a bath without it’s meaning something.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>[<em>Loftily.</em>] I talked it because I knew you needed it.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Steve</span></p>

<p>You haven’t said much about it these last two weeks.
Uh&mdash;your faith in it hasn’t weakened any?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>Weakened? It’s grown stronger with each new
thing I’ve come to know. And Mabel. She is with
Dr. Russell now. Dr. Russell is wonderful! From
what Mabel tells me I believe his analysis is going to
prove that I was right. Today I discovered a remarkable
confirmation of my theory in the hen-dream.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Steve</span></p>

<p>What is your theory?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>Well, you know about Lyman Eggleston. I’ve wondered
about him. I’ve never seen him, but I know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
he’s less bourgeois than Mabel’s other friends&mdash;more
intellectual&mdash;and [<em>Significantly</em>] she doesn’t see much
of him because Bob doesn’t like him.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Steve</span></p>

<p>But what’s the confirmation?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>Today I noticed the first syllable of his name.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Steve</span></p>

<p>Ly?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>No&mdash;egg.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Steve</span></p>

<p>Egg?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>[<em>Patiently.</em>] Mabel dreamed she was a <em>hen</em>.
[<em><span class="smcap">Steve</span> laughs.</em>] You wouldn’t laugh if you knew
how important names are in interpreting dreams.
Freud is full of just such cases in which a whole
hidden complex is revealed by a single significant
syllable&mdash;like this egg.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Steve</span></p>

<p>Doesn’t the traditional relation of hen and egg suggest
rather a maternal feeling?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>There is something maternal in Mabel’s love, of
course, but that’s only one element.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Steve</span></p>

<p>Well, suppose Mabel hasn’t a suppressed desire to
be this gentleman’s mother, but his beloved. What’s
to be done about it? What about Bob? Don’t you
think it’s going to be a little rough on him?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>That can’t be helped. Bob, like everyone else, must
face the facts of life. If Dr. Russell should arrive
independently at this same interpretation I shall not
hesitate to advise Mabel to leave her present husband.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Steve</span></p>

suppressed desire!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>That is interesting.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>He finished with me today&mdash;he got hold of my
complex&mdash;in the most amazing way! But, oh, Henrietta&mdash;it
is so terrible!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>Do calm yourself, Mabel. Surely there’s no occasion
for all this agitation.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>But there is! And when you think of the lives
that are affected&mdash;the readjustments that must be
made in order to bring the suppressed hell out of me
and save me from the insane asylum&mdash;!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>The insane asylum!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>You said that’s where these complexes brought people!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>What did the doctor tell you, Mabel?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>Oh, I don’t know how I can tell you&mdash;it is so

<p>I rather have my hand in at hearing the unbelievable.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>Henrietta, who would ever have thought it? How
can it be true? But the doctor is perfectly certain that

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>From the first. It’s been my theory all along.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>But, Henrietta, I didn’t know myself that I had

<p>What insane thing are you driving at?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>[<em>Blubbering.</em>] Henrietta, don’t you use that word
to me. I don’t <em>want</em> to go to the insane asylum.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>What did Dr. Russell say?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>Well, you see&mdash;oh, it’s the strangest thing! But
you know the voice in my dream that called “Step,
Hen!” Dr. Russell found out today that when I was
a little girl I had a story-book in words of one syllable
and I read the name Stephen wrong. I used to read
it S-t-e-p, step, h-e-n, hen. [<em>Dramatically.</em>] Step Hen
is Stephen. [<em>Enter <span class="smcap">Stephen</span>, his head bent over a
time-table.</em>] Stephen is Step Hen!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Steve</span></p>

<p>I? Step Hen?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>[<em>Triumphantly.</em>] S-t-e-p, step, H-e-n, hen, Stephen!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>[<em>Exploding.</em>] Well, what if Stephen is Step Hen?
[<em>Scornfully.</em>] Step Hen! Step Hen! For that ridiculous
coincidence&mdash;</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>Coincidence! But it’s childish to look at the mere
elements of a dream. You have to look <em>into</em> it&mdash;you
have to see what it <em>means</em>!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>On account of that trivial, meaningless play on
syllables&mdash;on that flimsy basis&mdash;you are ready&mdash;[<em>Wails.</em>]
O-h!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Steve</span></p>

<p>What on earth’s the matter? What has happened?
Suppose I <em>am</em> Step Hen? What about it? What
does it mean?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>[<em>Crying.</em>] It means&mdash;that I&mdash;have a suppressed
desire for <em>you</em>!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Steve</span></p>

<p>For me! The deuce you have! [<em>Feebly.</em>] What&mdash;er&mdash;makes
you think so?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>Dr. Russell has worked it out scientifically.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>Yes. Through the amazing discovery that Step Hen
equals Stephen!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>[<em>Tearfully.</em>] Oh, that isn’t all&mdash;that isn’t near all.
Henrietta won’t give me a chance to tell it. She’d
rather I’d go to the insane asylum than be unconventional.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>[<em>Drying her eyes.</em>] Oh, there’s such a lot about
names. [<em>With some pride.</em>] I don’t see how I ever
did it. It all works in together. I dreamed I was
a hen because that’s the first syllable of <em>Hen</em>-rietta’s
name, and when I dreamed I was a hen, I was putting
myself in Henrietta’s place.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>With Stephen?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>But there’s more about the names.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>Mabel, have you thought of Bob&mdash;dear old Bob&mdash;your

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>Oh, Henrietta, “my good, kind husband!”</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>Think of him, Mabel, out there alone in Chicago,
working his head off, fixing people’s <em>teeth</em>&mdash;for you!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>Yes, but think of the living Libido&mdash;in conflict
with petrified moral codes! And think of the perfectly
wonderful way the names all prove it. Dr. Russell
said he’s never seen anything more convincing. Just
look at Stephen’s last name&mdash;Brewster. I dream
I’m a hen, and the name Brewster&mdash;you have to say
its first letter by itself&mdash;and then the hen, that’s me,
she says to him: “Stephen, Be Rooster!”</p>

<p class="sd">[<em><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span> and <span class="smcap">Stephen</span> collapse into

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>Do you want Mabel to go away with you?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Steve</span></p>

<p>Well, but Mabel herself&mdash;her complex&mdash;her suppressed
desire&mdash;!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>[<em>Going to her.</em>] Mabel, are you going to insist
on going away with Stephen?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>I’d rather go with Stephen than go to the insane
asylum!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>For heaven’s sake, Mabel, drop that insane asylum!
If you <em>did</em> have a suppressed desire for Stephen hidden
away in you&mdash;God knows it isn’t hidden now. Dr.
Russell has brought it into your consciousness&mdash;with
a vengeance. That’s all that’s necessary to break up
a complex. Psychoanalysis doesn’t say you have to
<em>gratify</em> every suppressed desire.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Steve</span></p>

<p>[<em>Softly.</em>] Unless it’s for Lyman Eggleston.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

Brewster, I’d like to know why that interpretation

Step-Hen B-rooster. And <em>Hen</em>rietta. Pshaw, my
dear, Doc Russell’s got you beat a mile! [<em>He turns
away and chuckles.</em>] Be rooster!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>What has Lyman Eggleston got to do with it?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Steve</span></p>

<p>According to Henrietta, you, the hen, have a suppressed
desire for <em>Egg</em>leston, the egg.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>Henrietta, I think that’s indecent of you! He is
bald as an egg and little and fat&mdash;the idea of you
thinking such a thing of me!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p>Well, Bob isn’t little and bald and fat! Why don’t
you stick to your own husband? [<em>To <span class="smcap">Stephen</span>.</em>]
What if Dr. Russell’s interpretation has got mine “beat
a mile”? [<em>Resentful look at him.</em>] It would only
mean that Mabel doesn’t want Eggleston and does want
you. Does that mean she has to have you?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Mabel</span></p>

<p>But you said Mabel Snow&mdash;</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Henrietta</span></p>

<p><em>Mary</em> Snow! You’re not as much like her as you
think&mdash;substituting your name for hers! The cases
are entirely different. Oh, I wouldn’t have <em>believed</em>
this of you, Mabel. [<em>Beginning to cry.</em>] I brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>

<h2>TICKLESS TIME</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <em>A garden in Provincetown. On the spectator’s
right a two-story house runs back from the
proscenium&mdash;a door towards the front, a second-story
window towards the back. Across the back runs
a thick-set row of sunflowers nearly concealing a fence
or wall. Back of this are trees and sky. There is a
gate at the left rear corner of the garden. People
entering it come straight toward the front, down the
left side and, to reach the house
door, pass across the front of
the stage. A fence with sunflowers
like that at the back
closes off the left wing of the
stage&mdash;a tree behind this left
fence.</em></p>

<p><em>The sun-dial stands on a broad
step or pedestal which partly
masks the digging which takes
place behind it. The position of
the sun-dial is to the left of the
center of the stage midway between
front and back.</em></p>

<p><em>From behind the tree on the
left the late afternoon sun throws
a well-defined beam of light
upon the horizontal plate of the
sun-dial and upon the shaft
which supports it. On this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"><span class="normalfont">[276]</span></a></span>
shaft is the accompanying diagram: two feet high and
clearly visible.</em></p>

<p><em>On the plate of the sun-dial stands the alarm-clock.
A huge shovel leans against the wall of the house-corner
at the back.</em></p>

<p><em><span class="smcap">Ian</span> is at the sun-dial. He sights over the style to
some distant stake left rear, marking the north. He
then sights over the east and west line toward the six

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Ian</span></p>

<p>[<em>Turning toward house and calling excitedly.</em>]
Eloise! Oh, Eloise!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Eloise</span></p>

<p>[<em>Inside house.</em>] Hello!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Ian</span></p>

<p>Come quick! You’ll miss it.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Eloise</span></p>

<p>[<em>Poking her head out of the second-story window;
she cranes her neck to look straight up in the air.</em>]
What is it?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Ian</span></p>

<p>Come down here quick or you’ll miss it.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Eloise</span></p>

<p>[<em>Disappears from window. A moment later comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"><span class="normalfont">[277]</span></a></span>
running out, one braid of hair up and one braid down.
Again looks wildly up in the air.</em>] Where is it?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Ian</span></p>

<p>[<em>Absorbed in the sun-dial.</em>] Where’s what?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Eloise</span></p>

<p>The airplane.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Ian</span></p>

<p>Airplane? It’s the sun-dial. It’s right. Just look
at this six o’clock shadow. [<em>She goes around to the
other side of it.</em>] It’s absolutely, mathematically&mdash;you’re
in the way of the sun, Eloise. [<em>She steps
aside.</em>] Look! the style is set square on the true north&mdash;this
is the fifteenth of June&mdash;the clock is checked
to the second by telegraph with the observatory at
Washington and see! the clock is exactly nineteen
minutes and twenty seconds behind the shadow&mdash;the
precise difference between Provincetown local time and
standard Eastern time.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Eloise</span></p>

<p>Then the sun-dial’s really finished&mdash;and working
right! After all these, weeks! Oh, Ian!</p>

<p class="sd">[<em>Embraces him.</em></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Ian</span></p>

<p>It’s good to get it right after all those mistakes.
[<em>With vision.</em>] Why, Eloise, getting this right has
been a symbol of man’s whole search for truth&mdash;the
discovery and correction of error&mdash;the mind compelled
to conform step by step to astronomical fact&mdash;to
truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Eloise</span></p>

<p>[<em>Going to it again.</em>] And to think that it’s the sun-dial
which is true and the clock&mdash;all the clocks&mdash;are
wrong! I’m glad it is true. Alice Knight has
been here talking to me for an hour. I want to think
that something’s true.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Ian</span></p>

<p>That’s just it, Eloise. The sun-dial is more than
sun-dial. It’s a first-hand relation with truth. A personal
relation. When you take your time from a clock
you are mechanically getting information from a machine.
You’re nothing but a clock yourself.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Eloise</span></p>

<p>Like Alice Knight.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Ian</span></p>

<p>But the sun-dial&mdash;this shadow is an original document&mdash;a
scholar’s source.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Eloise</span></p>

<p>To tell time by the shadow of the sun&mdash;so large
and simple.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Ian</span></p>

<p>I wouldn’t call it simple. Here on this diagram
I have worked out&mdash;</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Eloise</span></p>

<p>Dearest, you know I can’t understand diagrams.
But I get the feeling of it, Ian&mdash;the sun, the North
star. I love to think that this [<em>Placing her hands on
the style</em>] is set by the North star. [<em>Her right hand
remains on the style, her left prolongs its line heavenward.</em>]<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
Why, if I could go on long enough I’d get <em>to</em>
the North star!</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Ian</span></p>

<p>[<em>Impressively.</em>] The line that passes along the edge
of this style joins the two poles of the heavens.
[<em><span class="smcap">Eloise</span> pulls away her hand as one who fears an
electric shock.</em>] Look at this slow shadow and what
you see is the spin of the earth on its axis. It is not
so much the measure of time as time itself made visible.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Eloise</span></p>

<p>[<em>Knitting her brows to get this: escaping to an impetuous
generality.</em>] Ian, which do you think is the
more wonderful&mdash;space <em>or</em> time?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Ian</span></p>

<p>[<em>Again sighting over his east and west lines. Good-humoredly.</em>]
Both are a little large for our approbation.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Eloise</span></p>

<p>[<em>Sitting on the steps and putting up the other braid.</em>]
Do you know, Ian, that’s the one thing about them
I don’t quite like. You can’t get very intimate with
them, can you? They make you so humble. That’s
one nice thing about a clock. A clock is sometimes
wrong.</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Ian</span></p>

<p>Don’t you want to live in a first-hand relation to
truth?</p>

<p class="ctr"><span class="smcap">Eloise</span></p>

<p>Yes; yes, I do&mdash;generally.</p>

I tell you this is <em>great</em>, Eloise. What is a clock?
Something agreed upon and arbitrarily imposed upon
us. Standard time. Not true time. Symbolizing the
whole standardization of our lives. Clocks! Why,
it is clockiness that makes America mechanical and
mean! Clock-minded! A clock is a little machine
that shuts us out from the wonder of time. [<em>A large
gesture with the shovel.</em>] Who thinks of spinning
worlds when looking at a clock? How <em>dare</em> clocks do
this to us? But the sun-dial&mdash;because there was creation,
because there are worlds outside our world, because
space is rhythm and time is flow that shadow
falls precisely there and not elsewhere! Bring them,
Eloise! I am digging the graves of the clocks!</p>

how to <em>dig</em>?</p>

<p class="sd">[<em><span class="smcap">Eddy</span>, who has been digging with speed

Well, I must say, the people who try to lead the right
kind of lives <em>always</em> do the wrong thing. [<em>Stiffly.</em>]
I am not accustomed to having my wedding presents
put in graves. Will you please dig it up, Eddy? It
will do very well on the mantel in our library. And
my back nearly broken digging for your cook!</p>

<p>Oh, Mr. Joyce, I’ve come to see your sun-clock
again. Mr. Stubbs says <em>he’ll</em> not be run from Philadelphia.

from the sun&mdash;[<em>Sees that the sun-dial is gone.</em>]
Oh, do you take it in at night?</p>

<p>You’ve <em>buried</em> the sun-clock? And dug up all the

That’s how a smart man’s appreciated! What did
you bury it for, Mr. Joyce?</p>

truth or feeling about truth. This is a world for
clocks.</p>

<p>Well, <em>I</em> want truth! And so does Johnnie Stubbs!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
If you’ll excuse my saying so, Mr. Joyce, after you’ve
made a thing that’s right you oughtn’t to bury it, even
if there is nobody to want it. And now that <em>I</em> want
it&mdash;[<em><span class="smcap">Mrs. Stubbs</span> takes the spade and begins to

Mr. Joyce, and as good as if it had never seen the
grave. [<em>She looks at the setting sun.</em>] And there’s
time for it to make its shadow before this sun has
gone.</p>
